the hype of Big Data, something within business intelligence projects is indeed changing. This is mainly because Big Data is not only about data, but also about a complete conceptual and technological stack including raw and processed data, storage, ways of managing data, processing and analytics. A challenge that becomes even trickier is the management of the quality of the data in Big Data environments. More than ever before the need for assessing the Quality-in-Use gains importance since the real contribution\u2013business value\u2013of data can be only estimated in its context of use. Although there exists different Data Quality models for assessing the quality of regular data, none of them has been adapted to Big Data. To fill this gap, we propose the \u201c3As Data Quality-in-Use model\u201d, which is composed of three Data Quality characteristics for assessing the levels of Data Quality-in-Use in Big Data projects: Contextual Adequacy, Operational Adequacy and Temporal Adequacy. The model can be integrated into any sort of Big Data project, as it is independent of any pre-conditions or technologies. The paper shows the way to use the model with a working example. The model accomplishes every challenge related to Data Quality program aimed for Big Data. The main conclusion is that the model can be used as an appropriate way to obtain the Quality-in-Use levels of the input data of the Big Data analysis, and those levels can be understood as indicators of trustworthiness and soundness of the results of the Big Data analysis.","Jorge Merino and Ismael Caballero and Bibiano Rivas and Manuel Serrano and Mario Piattini","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2015.11.024","2016","A Data Quality in Use model for Big Data","article"],[null,"Xintao Liu and Min Chen and Christophe Claramunt and Michael Batty and Mei-Po Kwan and Ahmad M.

However, before the data can be used its quality must be determined and appropriate regions extracted. Initially, such testing was done manually using graphs or basic rules, such as the value of a variable. With large data sets, such an approach will not work, since the amount of data to tested and the number of potential rules is too large. Therefore, there is a need for automated segmentation of the data set into different components. Such an approach has recently been proposed and tested using various types of industrial data. Although the industrial results are promising, there still remain many unanswered questions including how to handle a priori knowledge, over- or undersegmentation of the data set, and setting the appropriate thresholds for a given application. Solving these problems will provide a robust and reliable method for determining the data quality of a given data set.","Yuri A.W.

Errors for sure occur and how to correct them should be explored.\nMethods\nElectronic health records of 9,197,817 patients and 53,081,148 visits, totaling about 500 million records for 2006\u20132016, were transmitted from eight hospitals into an integrated database. We randomly selected 10% of patients, accumulated the primary keys for their tabulated data, and compared the key numbers in the transmitted data with those of the raw data. Errors were identified based on statistical testing and clinical reasoning.\nResults\nData were recorded in 1573 tables. Among these, 58 (3.7%) had different key numbers, with the maximum of 16.34\/1000. Statistical differences (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were found in 34 (58.6%), of which 15 were caused by changes in diagnostic codes, wrong accounts, or modified orders. For the rest, the differences were related to accumulation of hospital visits over time. In the remaining 24 tables (41.4%) without significant differences, three were revised because of incorrect computer programming or wrong accounts. For the rest, the programming was correct and absolute differences were negligible. The applicability was confirmed using the data of 2,730,883 patients and 15,647,468 patient-visits transmitted during 2017\u20132018, in which 10 (3.5%) tables were corrected.\nConclusion\nSignificant magnitude of inconsistent data does exist during the transmission of big data from diverse sources. Systematic validation is essential. Comparing the number of data tabulated using the primary keys allow us to rapidly identify and correct these scattered errors.","Yi-Chia Lee and Ying-Ting Chao and Pei-Ju Lin and Yen-Yun Yang and Yu-Cih Yang and Cheng-Chieh Chu and Yu-Chun Wang and Chin-Hao Chang and Shu-Lin Chuang and Wei-Chun Chen and Hsing-Jen Sun and Hsin-Cheng Tsou and Cheng-Fu Chou and Wei-Shiung Yang","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jfma.2021.12.024","2022","Quality assurance of integrative big data for medical research within a multihospital system","article"],["Big data is transforming biomedical research by integrating massive amounts of data from laboratory experiments, clinical investigations, healthcare records, and the internet of things.

Administrative data and registries can provide important contemporary evidence to inform clinical decision making and the delivery of health services. The following review outlines some important considerations for retrospective studies using administrative health databases and registries. First, these data sources have advantages (e.g. real-world applicability, timely data access, relatively lower research cost) and disadvantages (e.g. potential missing data, selection bias, confounding bias) that may be more or less relevant to different administrative databases or registries.

However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, which becomes a major factor that prevents them from being used for big data quality prediction. This is because the JIT modeling methods need to update the local regression model using the relevant samples that are searched through the lineal scan of the database during online operation. To solve this issue, the present work proposes a novel hashing-based JIT (HbJIT) modeling method that is suitable for big data quality prediction. In HbJIT, a family of locality-sensitive hash functions is firstly used to hash big data into a set of buckets, in which similar samples are grouped on themselves. During online prediction, HbJIT looks up multiple buckets that have a high probability of containing similar samples of a query object through the intelligent probing scheme, uses the data objects in the buckets as the candidate set of the results, and then filters the candidate objects using a linear scan. After filtering, the most relevant samples are used to construct the local regression model to yield the prediction of the query object. By integrating the multi-probe hashing strategy into the JIT learning framework, HbJIT can not only deal with process nonlinearity and time-varying characteristics but also is applicable to large-scale industrial processes. Experimental results on real-world dataset have demonstrated that the proposed HbJIT is time-efficient in processing large-scale datasets, and greatly reduces the online prediction time without compromising on the prediction accuracy.","Xinmin Zhang and Jiang Zhai and Zhihuan Song and Yuan Li","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-323-85159-6.50280-3","2022","Hashing-based just-in-time learning for big data quality prediction","incollection"],["Summary\nDiarrhoea is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite advances in the management of this condition. Understanding of the causes of diarrhoea in children in LMICs has advanced owing to large multinational studies and big data analytics computing the disease burden, identifying the important variables that have contributed to reducing this burden. The advent of the mobile phone has further enabled the management of childhood diarrhoea by providing both clinical support to health-care workers (such as diagnosis and management) and communicating preventive measures to carers (such as breastfeeding and vaccination reminders) in some settings. There are still challenges in addressing the burden of diarrhoeal diseases, such as incomplete patient information, underrepresented geographical areas, concerns about patient confidentiality, unequal partnerships between study investigators, and the reactive approach to outbreaks. A transparent approach to promote the inclusion of researchers in LMICs could address partnership imbalances.

We subsequently used a comprehensive search strategy to identify all neurosurgical studies using the NIS in the PubMed and MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to August 2021. Studies underwent qualitative categorization (years of NIS studied, neurosurgical subspecialty, age group, and thematic focus of study objective) and analysis of longitudinal trends.\nResults\nWe identified a canonical, 4-step protocol for NIS analysis: study population selection; defining additional clinical variables; identification and coding of outcomes; and statistical analysis. Methodological nuances discussed include identifying neurosurgery-specific admissions, addressing missing data, calculating additional severity and hospital-specific metrics, coding perioperative complications, and applying survey weights to make nationwide estimates. Inherent database limitations and common pitfalls of NIS studies discussed include lack of disease process\u2013specific variables and data after the index admission, inability to calculate certain hospital-specific variables after 2011, performing state-level analyses, conflating hospitalization charges and costs, and not following proper statistical methodology for performing survey-weighted regression.

The long-term variations in major aerosol types showed that in China the territory covered by typical anthropogenic aerosols was reduced from 21.38% to 11.76% over the past two decades, while dust aerosols decreased from 6.99% to 2.15%. The declining trend in anthropogenic aerosols could be attributed to reduced coal consumption and\/or favorable dispersion conditions, whereas decreasing dust aerosols were largely associated with increased vegetation cover and\/or weakened wind speed in the west. Overall, such advancements provide fresh evidence to improve our understanding of the emission control effect on haze pollution variations in China.","Ke Li and Kaixu Bai and Mingliang Ma and Jianping Guo and Zhengqiang Li and Gehui Wang and Ni-Bin Chang","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.isprsjprs.2022.09.001","2022","Spatially gap free analysis of aerosol type grids in China: First retrieval via satellite remote sensing and big data analytics","article"],["Angelica sinensis is a kind of traditional Chinese medicine with very good blood nourishing effect, and it is cultivated in many regions of China.

However, the challenges that big data collection and analytics can introduce in trust-based societies, like those of Scandinavia, are not yet understood. For instance, in the energy sector, data generated through smart appliances, like smart metering devices, can have collateral implications for the end-users. In this paper, we present a systematic review of scientific articles indexed in Scopus to identify possible relationships between the practices of collecting, processing, analysing, and using people's data and people's responses to such practices. We contextualise this by looking at research about Scandinavian societies and link this to the academic literature on big data and trust, big data and smart meters, data ethics and the energy sector, surveillance capitalism, and subsequently performing a reflexive thematic analysis. We broadly situate our understanding of culture in this context on the interactions between cognitive norms, material culture, and energy practices. Our analysis identified a number of articles discussing problems and solutions to do with the practices of surveillance capitalism. We also found that research addresses these challenges in different ways. While some research focuses on technological amendments to address users\u2019 privacy protection, only few examine the fundamental ethical questions that discuss how big data practices may change societies and increase their vulnerability. The literature suggests that even in highly trusting societies, like the ones found in Scandinavian countries, trust can be undermined and weakened.","Jaqueline de Godoy and Kathrin Otrel-Cass and Kristian H\u00f8yer Toft","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.egyai.2021.100079","2021","Transformations of trust in society: A systematic review of how access to big data in energy systems challenges Scandinavian culture","article"],["Big data changed the way in which we collect and analyze data. In particular, the amount of available information is constantly growing and organizations rely more and more on data analysis in order to achieve their competitive advantage. However, such amount of data can create a real value only if combined with quality: good decisions and actions are the results of correct, reliable and complete data. In such a scenario, methods and techniques for the Data Quality assessment can support the identification of suitable data to process. If for traditional database numerous assessment methods are proposed, in the Big Data scenario new algorithms have to be designed in order to deal with novel requirements related to variety, volume and velocity issues. In particular, in this paper we highlight that dealing with heterogeneous sources requires an adaptive approach able to trigger the suitable quality assessment methods on the basis of the data type and context in which data have to be used. Furthermore, we show that in some situations it is not possible to evaluate the quality of the entire dataset due to performance and time constraints. For this reason, we suggest to focus the Data Quality assessment only on a portion of the dataset and to take into account the consequent loss of accuracy by introducing a confidence factor as a measure of the reliability of the quality assessment procedure. We propose a methodology to build a Data Quality adapter module, which selects the best configuration for the Data Quality assessment based on the user main requirements: time minimization, confidence maximization, and budget minimization.

The volume of digital data in general and security event data in specific is increasing exponentially. The velocity with which security event data is generated and fed into a BDCA system is unpredictable. Therefore, a BDCA system should be highly scalable to deal with the unpredictable increase\/decrease in the velocity of security event data. However, there has been little effort to investigate the scalability of BDCA systems to identify and exploit the sources of scalability improvement. In this paper, we first investigate the scalability of a Spark-based BDCA system with default Spark settings. We then identify Spark configuration parameters (e.g., execution memory) that can significantly impact the scalability of a BDCA system. Based on the identified parameters, we finally propose a parameter-driven adaptation approach, SCALER, for optimizing a system's scalability. We have conducted a set of experiments by implementing a Spark-based BDCA system on a large-scale OpenStack cluster. We ran our experiments with four security datasets. We have found that (i) a BDCA system with default settings of Spark configuration parameters deviates from ideal scalability by 59.5% (ii) 9 out of 11 studied Spark configuration parameters significantly impact scalability and (iii) SCALER improves the BDCA system's scalability by 20.8% compared to the scalability with default Spark parameter setting.

The proposed method employs a new manifold visualization method, SLISEMAP, to reduce the feature dimensions with interpretability, utilizes lower upper bound estimation (LUBE) method to obtain the PIs, in which the broad learning system (BLS) is used as the basic training network model and the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is applied to optimize the weighting parameters of BLS under the LUBE framework. A hot-rolling steel coil dataset consisting of 39 variables and 1335 coil samples is used to validate the proposed method. Two Delta-based approaches, namely back propagation neural network (BPNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM); and three LUBE-based approaches, namely ABC-BPNN, ABC-ELM, and ABC-support vector regression (SVR) are compared with the proposed method.

At the same time, new technologies have provided unexpected opportunities for natural products chemists to ask and answer new and different questions. With this viewpoint, we discuss the evolution of big data as a part of natural products research and provide a few examples of how discoveries have been enabled by access to big data.

However, plant performance or phenotype (P) is determined by the combining effects of genotype (G), envirotype (E) and genotype by environment interaction (GEI). Phenotypes can be predicted more precisely by training a model using data collected from multiple sources, including spatiotemporal omics (genomics, phenomics and enviromics across time and space). Integration of 3D information profiles (G-P-E), each with multidimensionality, provides predictive breeding with both tremendous opportunities and great challenges. Here, we first review innovative technologies for predictive breeding. We then evaluate multidimensional information profiles that can be integrated with a predictive breeding strategy, particularly envirotypic data, which have largely been neglected in data collection and nearly untouched in model construction. We propose a smart breeding scheme, integrated genomic-enviromic prediction (iGEP), as an extension of genomic prediction, using integrated multiomics information, big data technology and artificial intelligence (mainly focus on machine and deep learning). How to implement iGEP was discussed, including spatiotemporal models, environmental indices, factorial and spatiotemporal structure of plant breeding data, and cross-species prediction. A strategy is then proposed for prediction-based crop redesign at both the macro (individual, population and species) and micro (gene, metabolism and network) scales.

However, the battery is a complex electrochemical system with hardly observable and simulatable internal chemical reactions, and it is challenging to estimate the state of battery accurately. This paper proposes a novel flexible and reliable battery management method based on the battery big data platform and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology. First of all, to integrate the battery big data resources in the cloud, a Cyber-physical battery management framework is defined and served as the basic data platform for battery modeling issues. And to improve the quality of the collected battery data in the database, this work reports the first attempt to develop an adaptive data cleaning method for the cloud battery management issue. Furthermore, a deep learning algorithm-based feature extraction model, as well as a feature-oriented battery modeling method, is developed to mitigate the under-fitting problem and improve the accuracy of the cloud-based battery model. The actual operation data of electric buses is used to validate the proposed methodologies. The maximum data restoring error can be limited within 1.3% in the experiments, which indicates that the proposed data cleaning method is able to improve the cloud battery data quality effectively. Meanwhile, the maximum SoC estimation error in the proposed feature-oriented battery modeling method is within 2.47%, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Shuangqi Li and Pengfei Zhao","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.est.2020.102064","2021","Big data driven vehicle battery management method: A novel cyber-physical system perspective","article"],["Purpose\/Objective\nOutside of randomized clinical trials, it is difficult to develop clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for radiotherapy (RT) practice guidelines due to lack of comprehensive real-world data.

Relevance, an indispensable dimension of DQ, focusing on \u201cfitness for requirement\u201d, can arouse the user\u2019s interest in exploiting the data source. It has two-level evaluations: (1) the amount of data that meets the user\u2019s requirements; (2) the matching degree of these relevant data. However, there lack works of DQ assessment at dimension of relevance, especially for unstructured image data which focus on semantic similarity. When we try to evaluate semantic relevance between an image data source and a query (requirement), there are three challenges: (1) how to extract semantic information with generalization ability for all image data? (2) how to quantify relevance by fusing the quantity of relevant data and the degree of similarity comprehensively? (3) how to improve assessing efficiency of relevance in a big data scenario by design of an effective architecture? To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware data quality assessment (SDQA) architecture which includes off-line analysis and on-line assessment. In off-line analysis, for an image data source, we first transform all images into hash codes using our improved Deep Self-taught Hashing (IDSTH) algorithm which can extract semantic features with generalization ability, then construct a graph using hash codes and restricted Hamming distance, next use our designed Semantic Hash Ranking (SHR) algorithm to calculate the importance score (rank) for each node (image), which takes both the quantity of relevant images and the degree of semantic similarity into consideration, and finally rank all images in descending order of score. During on-line assessment, we first convert the user\u2019s query into hash codes using IDSTH model, then retrieve matched images to collate their importance scores, and finally help the user determine whether the image data source is fit for his requirement.

While dealing with big sensing data streams, a Data Stream Manager (DSM) must always verify the security (i.e. authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality) to ensure end-to-end security and maintain data quality. Existing technologies are not suitable, because real time introduces delay in data stream. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Prime Number Based Security Verification (DPBSV) scheme for big data streams. Our scheme is based on a common shared key that updated dynamically by generating synchronized prime numbers. The common shared key updates at both ends, i.e., source sensing devices and DSM, without further communication after handshaking. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of our DPBSV scheme show that it can significantly improve the efficiency of verification process by reducing the time and utilizing a smaller buffer size in DSM.","Deepak Puthal and Surya Nepal and Rajiv Ranjan and Jinjun Chen","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jcss.2016.02.005","2017","A dynamic prime number based efficient security mechanism for big sensing data streams","article"],["Wireless networking has made enormous improvements.

In multi-criteria based decision support approaches, a suitability degree is computed for each option, reflecting how suitable that option is considering the preferences of the decision maker. Nowadays, it becomes more and more common that data of different quality, originating from different data sets and different data providers have to be integrated and processed in order to compute the suitability degrees. Also, data sets can be very large such that their data become commonly prone to incompleteness, imprecision and uncertainty. Hence, not all data used for decision making can be trusted to the same extent and consequently, neither the results of computations with such data can be trusted to the same extent. For this reason, data quality assessment becomes an important aspect of a decision making process. To correctly inform the users, it is essential to communicate not only the computed suitability degrees of the available options, but also the confidence about these suitability degrees as can be derived from data quality assessment. In this paper a novel multi-dimensional approach for data quality assessment in multi-criteria decision making, supporting the computation of associated confidence degrees, is presented. Providing confidence information adds an extra dimension to the decision making process and leads to more soundly decisions. The added value of the approach is illustrated with aspects of a geographic decision making process.","Guy {De Tr\u00e9} and Robin {De Mol} and Antoon Bronselaer","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ins.2017.09.008","2018","Handling veracity in multi-criteria decision-making: A multi-dimensional approach","article"],["This chapter describes the general architecture and functional components of the cloud-based big data infrastructure (BDI).

One of the significant areas of opportunity in digital marketing is influencer marketing, but identifying these influencers from big data sets is a continual challenge. This research illustrates how one type of influencer, the market maven, can be identified using big data. Using a mixed-method combination of both self-report survey data and publicly accessible big data, we gathered 556,150 tweets from 370 active Twitter users. We then proposed and tested a range of social-media-based metrics to identify market mavens. Findings show that market mavens (when compared to non-mavens) have more followers, post more often, have less readable posts, use more uppercase letters, use less distinct words, and use hashtags more often. These metrics are openly available from public Twitter accounts and could integrate into a broad-scale decision support system for marketing and information systems managers. These findings have the potential to improve influencer identification effectiveness and efficiency, and thus improve influencer marketing.","Paul Harrigan and Timothy M.

A crisis threatens organizational performance; therefore, a data-driven strategy will result in an efficient and timely reflection, which increases the success of crisis management.

The paper derives human reliability data for two driving tasks, stopping at red signals and controlling speed on approach to buffer stops. In the first of these cases, a tool has been developed that can estimate the number of times a signal is approached at red by trains on the Great Britain (GB) rail network. The tool has been developed using big data techniques and ideas, recording and analysing millions of pieces of data from live operational feeds to update and summarise statistics from thousands of signal locations in GB on a daily basis. The resulting driver reliability data are compared to similar analyses of other train driving tasks. This shows human reliability approaching the currently accepted limits of human performance. It also shows higher error rates amongst freight train drivers than passenger train drivers for these tasks. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the task specific performance limits if further improvements in human reliability are sought. It also provides a practical example of how big data could play an increasingly important role in system error management, whether from the perspective of understanding normal performance and the limits of performance for specific tasks or as the basis for dynamic safety indicators which, if not leading, could at least become closer to real time.","Chris Harrison and Julian Stow and Xiaocheng Ge and Jonathan Gregory and Huw Gibson and Alice Monk","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.apergo.2022.103795","2022","At the limit?

However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation.

In practice, this task can be outsourced to a cloud service, and thus, a service customer may be interested in estimating the costs of a record linkage solution before executing it. Since the execution time of a record linkage solution depends on a combination of various algorithms, their respective parameter values and the employed cloud infrastructure, in practice it is hard to perform an a priori estimation of infrastructure costs for executing a record linkage task. Besides estimating customer costs, the estimation of record linkage costs is also important to evaluate whether (or not) the application of a set of RL parameter values will satisfy predefined time and budget restrictions. Aiming to tackle these challenges, we propose a theoretical model for estimating RL costs taking into account the main steps that may influence the execution time of the RL task.

The construction of a goodwill dynamic model has two purposes, namely, to increase sales and the return rate. The optimal decisions for 3 players under two different cooperative scenarios are obtained, namely, the retailer payment scenario (scenario D) and the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario (scenario S). The supply chain members gain more profit or achieve a higher level of goodwill for products under certain conditions, i.e., a high residual value from remanufacturing, a high sharing rate of residual value from the retailer's recycled products, and a low recycling cost. Interestingly, the wholesale price increases with the residual value of recycled products when goodwill effectiveness is low, while the price declines when goodwill effectiveness is high. After comparing two cooperative scenarios, the result shows that an Internet service platform will invest more in Big Data marketing under the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario, and cooperation between the manufacturer and the Internet service platform can help improve the goodwill of enterprises or products. Moreover, the manufacturer cost-sharing scenario is payoff-Pareto-improving in most cases through the coordination of a cost-sharing rate, and the effectiveness of Big Data marketing exerts a positive effect on goodwill and the development of the industry.

Next, the sample cities were clustered in terms of major socio-economic characteristics, and then the effects of data governance were examined by constructing multivariate regression models for each city cluster with ordinary least squares (OLS). The results showed that the constructed regression models produced good interpretation of fire risk in different types of cities, with coefficient of determination (R2) in each model exceeding 0.65. Among the indicators, the development of infrastructures (e.g. data collection devices and data analysis platforms), the level of data use, and the updating of fire risk related data were proved to produce significant effects on the reduction of fire frequency and fire consequence. Moreover, the organizational maturity of data governance was proved to be helpful in reducing fire frequency. For the cities with large population, the cross-department sharing of high-value data was found to be another important determinant of urban fire frequency. In comparison with existing statistical models which interpreted fire risk with general social factors (with the highest R2\u00a0=\u00a00.60), these new regression models presented a better statistical performance (with the average R2\u00a0=\u00a00.72).

The insight of this paper is that lossy compression can unleash the power of compression to IoT because, as compared with its counterpart (a lossless one), it can significantly reduce the data volume when the spatiotemporal characteristics of IoT sensor data are properly exploited. However, lossy compression faces the challenge of compressing too much data thus losing data fidelity, which might affect the quality of the data and potential analytics outcomes. To understand the impact of lossy compression on IoT data management and analytics, we evaluated four classification algorithms with reconstructed agricultural sensor data based on various energy concentration. Specifically, we applied three transformation-based lossy compression mechanisms to five real-world weather datasets collected at different sampling granularities from IoT weather stations. Our experimental results indicate that there is a strong positive correlation between the concentrated energy of the transformed coefficients and the compression ratio as well as the data quality. While we observed a general trend where much higher compression ratios can be achieved at the cost of a decrease in quality, we also observed that the impact on the classification accuracy varies among the data sets and algorithms we evaluated.

As such systems are increasingly requested to make decisions that are consequential to individuals, communities and society at large, their failures cannot be tolerated, and they are subject to stringent regulatory and ethical requirements. However, they all rely on data which is not only big, open and linked but varied, dynamic and streamed at high speeds in real-time. Managing such data is challenging. To overcome such challenges and utilize opportunities for BDAS, organizations are increasingly developing advanced data governance capabilities. This paper reviews challenges and approaches to data governance for such systems, and proposes a framework for data governance for trustworthy BDAS. The framework promotes the stewardship of data, processes and algorithms, the controlled opening of data and algorithms to enable external scrutiny, trusted information sharing within and between organizations, risk-based governance, system-level controls, and data control through shared ownership and self-sovereign identities. The framework is based on 13 design principles and is proposed incrementally, for a single organization and multiple networked organizations.","Marijn Janssen and Paul Brous and Elsa Estevez and Luis S.

Their complexity comes from the fact that they are hard to predict, hard to extinguish and cause enormous financial losses. To address this issue, many research efforts have been conducted in order to monitor, predict and prevent wildfires using several Artificial Intelligence techniques and strategies such as Big Data, Machine Learning, and Remote Sensing. The latter offers a rich source of satellite images, from which we can retrieve a huge amount of data that can be used to monitor wildfires. The method used in this paper combines Big Data, Remote Sensing and Data Mining algorithms (Artificial Neural Network and SVM) to process data collected from satellite images over large areas and extract insights from them to predict the occurrence of wildfires and avoid such disasters. For this reason, we implemented a methodology that serves this purpose by building a dataset based on Remote Sensing data related to the state of the crops (NDVI), meteorological conditions (LST), as well as the fire indicator \u201cThermal Anomalies\u201d, these data, were acquired from \u201cMODIS\u201d (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), a key instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites.

The only recent available country-wide LC map of Iran was generated in 2016 by the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with a considerably low accuracy. Therefore, the production of an up-to-date and accurate Iran-wide LC map using the most recent remote sensing, machine learning, and big data processing algorithms is required. Moreover, it is important to develop an efficient method for automatic LC generation for various time periods without the need to collect additional ground truth data from this immense country. Therefore, this study was conducted to fulfill two objectives. First, an improved Iranian LC map with 13 LC classes and a spatial resolution of 10\u00a0m was produced using multi-temporal synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets applied to an object-based Random forest (RF) algorithm. For this purpose, 2,869 Sentinel-1 and 11,994 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired in 2017 were processed and classified within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform allowing big geospatial data analysis. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final Iran-wide LC map for 2017 was 95.6% and 0.95, respectively, indicating the considerable potential of the proposed big data processing method. Second, an efficient automatic method was developed based on Sentinel-2 images to migrate ground truth samples from a reference year to automatically generate an LC map for any target year. The OA and KC for the LC map produced for the target year 2019 were 91.35% and 0.91, respectively, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method for automatic LC mapping.

Therefore, the volume, variety, velocity, and quality of data cannot be compromised. This study aims to explore the data management challenges encountered by practitioners developing systems with DL components, identify the potential solutions from the literature and validate the solutions through a multiple case study. We identified 20 data management challenges experienced by DL practitioners through a multiple interpretive case study. Further, we identified 48 articles through a systematic literature review that discuss the solutions for the data management challenges. With the second round of multiple case study, we show that many of these solutions have limitations and are not used in practice due to a combination of four factors: high cost, lack of skill-set and infrastructure, inability to solve the problem completely, and incompatibility with certain DL use cases. Thus, data management for data-intensive DL models in production is complicated. Although the DL technology has achieved very promising results, there is still a significant need for further research in the field of data management to build high-quality datasets and streams that can be used for building production-ready DL systems.

However, a PMS must take into account the various challenges associated with Industry 4.0, including the availability of large amounts of data. While it represents an opportunity for companies to improve performance, big data does not necessarily mean good data.

To address this issue, we propose a method to model uncertainty in key performance indicators (KPIs).

The method developed allows calculating this uncertainty m for the input data of the performance management system. We show how these modeled uncertainties should be propagated to the KPIs. For these KPI uncertainties, we have defined rules to support decision-making. The method developed, based on the theory of belief functions, is part of a methodology we propose to define and extract smart data from massive data. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use this theory to model uncertain performance indicators.

Digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, cloud computing, blockchain and 5G have effectively improved the efficiency of efforts in epidemic monitoring, virus tracking, prevention, control and treatment. Surveillance to halt COVID-19 has raised privacy concerns, as many governments are willing to overlook privacy implications to save lives. The purpose of this paper is to conduct a focused Systematic Literature Review (SLR), to explore the potential benefits and implications of using digital technologies such as AI, big data and cloud to track COVID-19 amongst people in different societies. The aim is to highlight the risks of security and privacy to personal data when using technology to track COVID-19 in societies and identify ways to govern these risks. The paper uses the SLR approach to examine 40 articles published during 2020, ultimately down selecting to the most relevant 24 studies. In this SLR approach we adopted the following steps; formulated the problem, searched the literature, gathered information from studies, evaluated the quality of studies, analysed and integrated the outcomes of studies while concluding by interpreting the evidence and presenting the results. Papers were classified into different categories such as technology use, impact on society and governance. The study highlighted the challenge for government to balance the need of what is good for public health versus individual privacy and freedoms. The findings revealed that although the use of technology help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, government surveillance to halt has sparked privacy concerns.

In this paper, we explore this issue. Starting with an examination of granularities from a database perspective, we discuss new challenges of Big Data.

In particular, aggregation of DBKWS results is closely related to studies in granularities and granulation, which echoes L. Zadeh's famous formula: Granulation = Summarization.

Effective insurance can serve as both a measure to distribute, and a method to communicate risk. In order for insurance to fulfil these roles successfully, policy pricing and cover choices must be risk-based and founded on accurate information. This is reliant on a robust evidence base forming the foundation of policy choices. This paper focuses on the evidence available to insurers and emergent innovation in the use of data. The main risk considered is coastal flooding, for which the insurance sector offers an option for potential adaptation, capable of increasing resilience. However, inadequate supply and analysis of data have been highlighted as factors preventing insurance from fulfilling this role. Research was undertaken to evaluate how data are currently, and could potentially, be used within risk evaluations for the insurance industry. This comprised of 50 interviews with those working and associated with the London insurance market. The research reveals new opportunities, which could facilitate improvements in risk-reflective pricing of policies. These relate to a new generation of data collection techniques and analytics, such as those associated with satellite-derived data, IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, cloud computing, and Big Data solutions. Such technologies present opportunities to reduce moral hazard through basing predictions and pricing of risk on large empirical datasets. The value of insurers' claims data is also revealed, and is shown to have the potential to refine, calibrate, and validate models and methods. The adoption of such data-driven techniques could enable insurers to re-evaluate risk ratings, and in some instances, extend coverage to locations and developments, previously rated as too high a risk to insure. Conversely, other areas may be revealed more vulnerable, which could generate negative impacts for residents in these regions, such as increased premiums. However, the enhanced risk awareness generated, by new technology, data and data analytics, could positively alter future planning, development and investment decisions.","Alexander G.

For injection wells, shut-in data can be collected and analyzed after each injection cycle to evaluate the well injectivity and predict the well longevity. However, any interactive analysis of the pressure data could be subjective and time-consuming. In this study a novel cloud-based approach to automatically analyzing pressure data is presented, which aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of pressure transient analysis. There are two fundamental requirements for automated pressure transient analysis: 1) Pressure data needs to be automatically retrieved from field sites and fed to the analyzer; 2) The engineer can automatically select instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP), identify flow regimes, and determine the fracture closure point if any. To meet these requirements as well as to take advantage of cloud storage and computing technologies, a web-based application has been developed to pull real time injection data from any field sites and push it to a cloud database. A built-in pressure transient workflow has been also proposed to detect any stored or real-time pressure data and perform pressure analysis automatically if the required data is available. The automated pressure transient analysis technology has been applied to multiple injection projects. In general, the analysis results including formation and fracture properties (i.e. permeability, fracture half length, skin factor, and fracture closure pressure) are comparable to results from interactive analysis. Any discrepancies are mainly caused by poor data quality. Issues such as inconsistent selections of ISIP and different slopes defined for pre and after closure analyses also contribute to the divergence. Overall, the automated pressure transient analysis provides consistent results as the exact same criteria are applied to the pressure data, and analysis results are independent of the analyzer's experience and knowledge. As data from oil\/gas industry increases exponentially over time, automated data transmission, storage, analysis and access are becoming necessary to maximize the value of the data and reduce operation cost. The automated pressure transient analysis presented here demonstrates that cloud storage and computing combined with automated analysis tools is a viable way to overcome big data challenges faced by oil\/gas industry professionals.","Yonggui Guo and Ibrahim Mohamed and Ali Zidane and Yashesh Panchal and Omar Abou-Sayed and Ahmed Abou-Sayed","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.petrol.2020.107627","2021","Automated pressure transient analysis: A cloud-based approach","article"],["Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer exciting new avenues for leadership research.

For this purpose, methods of discovering variables with non-standard univariate marginal distributions are proposed.

To address this type of non-robustness, the L-moments are considered. Using these in practice, however, has a limitation since they do not take zero values at the Gaussian distributions to which the shape of a marginal distribution is most naturally compared. As a remedy, Gaussian Centered L-moments are proposed, which share advantages of the L-moments but have zeros at the Gaussian distributions. The strength of Gaussian Centered L-moments over other conventional moments is shown in theoretical and practical aspects such as their performances in screening important genes in cancer genetics data.","Hyowon An and Kai Zhang and Hannu Oja and J.S.

Analyzing and understanding this time-dependent data poses several non-trivial challenges to information visualization. Materials and methods: To address this Big Data challenge, we present a set of novel methods to analyze aircraft trajectories with interactive image-based information visualization techniques.As a result, we address the scalability challenges in terms of data manipulation and open questions by presenting a set of related visual analysis methods that focus on decision-support in the ATC domain. All methods use image-based techniques, in order to outline the advantages of such techniques in our application context, and illustrated by means of use-cases from the ATC domain. Results: For each considered use-case, we outline the type of questions posed by domain experts, data involved in addressing these questions, and describe the specific image-based techniques we used to address these questions. Further, for each of the proposed techniques, we describe the visual representation and interaction mechanisms that have been used to address the above-mentioned goals.

During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption, network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail.

Building upon the ongoing experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this short communication, we discuss three potential mechanisms that, in our opinion, can mitigate the impacts of major crises or disasters in agriculture: resilience-promoting policies, community marketing schemes, and smart farming technology. We argue that resilience-promoting policies should focus on the development of crisis management plans and enhance farmers' capacity to cope with external disturbances. We also stress the need to promote community marketing conduits that ensure an income floor for farmers while in parallel facilitating consumer access to agrifood products when mainstream distribution channels under-serve them.

Existing case law and regulations are inadequate to address the potential risks and issues related to this change of paradigm in social investigation. This is due to the fact that both the right to privacy and the more recent right to data protection are protected as individual rights. The social dimension of these rights has been taken into account by courts and policymakers in various countries. Nevertheless, the rights holder has always been the data subject and the rights related to informational privacy have mainly been exercised by individuals. This atomistic approach shows its limits in the existing context of mass predictive analysis, where the larger scale of data processing and the deeper analysis of information make it necessary to consider another layer, which is different from individual rights. This new layer is represented by the collective dimension of data protection, which protects groups of persons from the potential harms of discriminatory and invasive forms of data processing. On the basis of the distinction between individual, group and collective dimensions of privacy and data protection, the author outlines the main elements that characterise the collective dimension of these rights and the representation of the underlying interests.","Alessandro Mantelero","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.clsr.2016.01.014","2016","Personal data for decisional purposes in the age of analytics: From an individual to a collective dimension of data protection","article"],["Nowadays, IoT, cloud computing, mobile and social networks are generating a transformation in social processes.

In this paper, we examine existing standards for implementing PHM in the industrial field and discuss the limitations within SMEs. Based on that, a novel strategy to implement a data-driven PHM approach in SMEs is proposed. Accordingly, the data management process and the impact of data quality are reviewed to address some critical data problems in SMEs (e.g., data volume and data accuracy). A first set of simulations was carried out to study the impact of the data volume and percentage of missing data on classification problems in PHM. A general model of the evolution of the results accuracy in function of data volume and missing data is then generated, and an economic data volume notion is proposed for data infrastructure resizing. The proposed strategy and the developed models are then applied to the Scoder enterprise, which is a French SME. The feedback on the first results of this application is reported and discussed.","N.

Whilst an understanding of marine debris risks is steadily advancing, monitoring at spatial and temporal scales relevant to management remains limited.

Here we present 10-years of Australia's largest marine debris database - the Australian Marine Debris Initiative (AMDI), in which we perform systematic data filtering, test for differences between collecting groups, and report patterns in marine debris. We defined five stages of data filtering to address issues in data quality and to limit inference to ocean-facing sandy beaches. Significant differences were observed in the average accumulation of items between filtered and remaining data. Further, differences in sampling were compared between collecting groups at the same site (e.g., government, NGOs, and schools), where no significant differences were observed. The filtering process removed 21% of events due to data quality issues and a further 42% of events to restrict analyses to ocean-facing sandy beaches. The remaining 7275 events across 852 sites allowed for an assessment of debris patterns at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Hard plastics were the most common material found on beaches both nationally and regionally, consisting of up to 75% of total debris. Nationally, land and sea-sourced items accounted for 48% and 7% of debris, respectively, with most debris found on the east coast of Australia. This study demonstrates the value of citizen science datasets with broad spatial and temporal coverage, and the importance of data filtering to improve data quality. The citizen science presented provides an understanding of debris patterns on Australia's ocean beaches and can serve as a foundation for future source reduction plans.","Jordan Gacutan and Emma L.

Combining urban morphology, dynamic traffic emission, regional and local meteorology, physicochemical transformations in air quality models using big data fusion technology, an ultra-fine resolution modeling system was developed to provide air quality data down to street level. Based on one-year ultra-fine resolution data, this study investigated the effects of pollution heterogeneity on the individual and population exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated and urbanized cities. Sharp fine-scale variabilities in air pollution were revealed within individual city blocks. Using traditional 1\u00a0km average to represent individual exposure resulted in a positively skewed deviation of up to 200% for high-end exposure individuals. Citizens were disproportionally affected by air pollution, with annual pollutant concentrations varied by factors of 2 to 5 among 452 District Council Constituency Areas (DCCAs) in Hong Kong, indicating great environmental inequities among the population. Unfavorable city planning resulted in a positive spatial coincidence between pollution and population, which increased public exposure to air pollutants by as large as 46% among districts in Hong Kong. Our results highlight the importance of ultra-fine pollutant data in quantifying the heterogeneity in pollution exposure in the dense urban area and the critical role of smart urban planning in reducing exposure inequities.","Wenwei Che and Yumiao Zhang and Changqing Lin and Yik Him Fung and Jimmy C.H.

A considerable proportion of the geospatial data contains semantic information that indicates different categories of human activities occurring at exact geographic locations. Such information is often lacking in remote sensing data. In addition, the remarkable progress in machine learning provides toolkits for demographers to model complex nonlinear correlations between population and heterogeneous geographic covariates.

Reading reviews from the last webpage only, or from the first webpage and last webpage simultaneously, can promote a greater review volume than reading reviews in other positions.

However, there many barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains. It is therefore necessary for manufacturing companies to identify and examine the nature of each barrier. Previous studies have mostly built conceptual frameworks for BDA in a given situation and have ignored examining the nature of the barriers to BDA. Due to the significance of both BD and BDA, this research aims to identify and examine the critical barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains in the context of Bangladesh. This research explores the existing body of knowledge by examining these barriers using a Delphi-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Data were obtained from five Bangladeshi manufacturing companies. The findings of this research are as follows: (i) data-related barriers are most important, (ii) technology-related barriers are second, and (iii) the five most important components of these barriers are (a) lack of infrastructure, (b) complexity of data integration, (c) data privacy, (d) lack of availability of BDA tools and (e) high cost of investment. The findings can assist industrial managers to understand the actual nature of the barriers and potential benefits of using BDA and to make policy regarding BDA adoption in manufacturing supply chains.

In this study, we propose a new fine-grained parallelization\/distribution approach for populating the Data Warehouse (DW).

In our approach, an ETL process is described in terms of its core functionalities which can run on a cluster of computers according to the MapReduce (MR) paradigm. The novel approach allows thereby the distribution of the ETL process at three levels: the \u201cprocess\u201d level for coarse-grained distribution and the \u201cfunctionality\u201d and \u201celementary functions\u201d levels for fine-grained distribution.

As a result, ship operators will have to monitor and report the verified amount of CO2 emitted by their vessels on voyages to, from and between EU ports and will also be required to provide information on energy efficiency parameters. The MRV is a data-oriented regulation requiring ship operators to capture and monitor the ship emissions and other related data and although it is a regional regulation at the moment there is scope for the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to implement it globally in the near future.","Ibna Zaman and Kayvan Pazouki and Rose Norman and Shervin Younessi and Shirley Coleman","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.proeng.2017.08.182","2017","Challenges and Opportunities of Big Data Analytics for Upcoming Regulations and Future Transformation of the Shipping Industry","article"],["Value creation is a major sustainability factor for enterprises, in addition to profit maximization and revenue generation.

Hofstede's cultural dimensions are used to inform and frame our research hypotheses. Findings suggest that Chinese and American perspectives differ on individual data values, with the Chinese being more open to data collection and analytic techniques targeted toward individuals. Furthermore, support is found that US respondents have a more favorable view of businesses' use of data analytics. Finally, there is a strong difference in the attitudes toward governmental use of data, where US respondents do not favor governmental big data analytics usage and the Chinese respondents indicated a greater acceptance of governmental data usage. These findings are helpful in better understanding appropriate technological change and adoption from a societal perspective.

A major open challenge that AI will need to address before its integration in the clinical routine is that of algorithmic bias. Most AI algorithms need big datasets to learn from, but several groups of the human population have a long history of being absent or misrepresented in existing biomedical datasets. If the training data is misrepresentative of the population variability, AI is prone to reinforcing bias, which can lead to fatal outcomes, misdiagnoses, and lack of generalization. Here, we describe the challenges in rendering AI algorithms fairer, and we propose concrete steps for addressing bias using tools from the field of open science.","Natalia Norori and Qiyang Hu and Florence Marcelle Aellen and Francesca Dalia Faraci and Athina Tzovara","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.patter.2021.100347","2021","Addressing bias in big data and AI for health care: A call for open science","article"],["Based on the concept and research status of big data, we analyze and examine the importance of constructing the knowledge system of nursing science for the development of the nursing discipline in the context of big data and propose that it is necessary to establish big data centers for nursing science to share resources, unify language standards, improve professional nursing databases, and establish a knowledge system structure.","Ruifang Zhu and Shifan Han and Yanbing Su and Chichen Zhang and Qi Yu and Zhiguang Duan","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ijnss.2019.03.001","2019","The application of big data and the development of nursing science: A discussion paper","article"],["Big data and deep learning will profoundly change various areas of professions and research in the future.

To minimise such errors in advance, this paper presents a big data analytics based fault prediction approach for shop floor scheduling. Within the context, machining tasks, machining resources, and machining processes are represented by data attributes. Based on the available data on the shop floor, the potential fault\/error patterns, referring to machining errors, machine faults and maintenance states, are mined for unsuitable scheduling arrangements before machining as well as upcoming errors during machining. Comparing the data-represented tasks with the mined error patterns, their similarities or differences are calculated. Based on the calculated similarities, the fault probabilities of the scheduled tasks or the current machining tasks can be obtained, and they provide a reference of decision making for scheduling and rescheduling the tasks. By rescheduling high-risk tasks carefully, the potential errors can be avoided. In this paper, the architecture of the approach consisting of three steps in three levels is proposed. Furthermore, big data are considered in three levels, i.e. local data, local network data and cloud data.

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming.

This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios.

They are fundamental to biogeochemical cycling, interspecies interactions, food production, and drug bioprocessing, as well as playing less heroic roles as difficult to treat human infections and devastating plant pathogens. Despite community efforts to estimate and catalog fungal diversity, we have only named and described a minute fraction of the fungal world. The identification, characterization, and conservation of fungal diversity is paramount to preserving fungal bioresources, and to understanding and predicting ecosystem cycling and the evolution and epidemiology of fungal disease. Although species and ecosystem conservation are necessarily the foundation of preserving this diversity, there is value in expanding our definition of conservation to include the protection of biological collections, ecological metadata, genetic and genomic data, and the methods and code used for our analyses. These definitions of conservation are interdependent. For example, we need metadata on host specificity and biogeography to understand rarity and set priorities for conservation. To aid in these efforts, we need to draw expertise from diverse fields to tie traditional taxonomic knowledge to data obtained from modern -omics-based approaches, and support the advancement of diverse research perspectives. We also need new tools, including an updated framework for describing and tracking species known only from DNA, and the continued integration of functional predictions to link genetic diversity to functional and ecological diversity. Here, we review the state of fungal diversity research as shaped by recent technological advancements, and how changing viewpoints in taxonomy, -omics, and systematics can be integrated to advance mycological research and preserve fungal biodiversity.","Lotus A.

With big data and artificial intelligence technologies, it is possible to estimate personalized air pollution exposure and synchronize it with activity, health, quality of life and behavioural data, and provide real-time, personalized and interactive alert and advice to improve the health and well-being of individual citizens. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM2.5 and PM1.0 and NO2) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM1.0 and PM2.5, NO2 exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change.

How can AI and big data be used to facilitate environmental decision-making? Do AI and big data serve those most at risk of environmental pollution? Who should own and govern AI and big data? This special issue brings together researchers in relevant fields of AI and environmental science to address these pertinent questions. First, we will review the existing works which attempt to address these four questions. Second, we summarize the significance and novelty of six articles included in our special issue in addressing these four questions. Finally, we highlight the important principles of AI for Social Good, which can help distinguish good from bad environmental decisions based on AI and big data technologies.","Victor O.K.

Hence, accurate estimates of air pollutant emissions of these fast-changing LDGVs are vital for air quality management, human healthcare, and ecological protection. However, this issue is poorly quantified due to insufficient reserves of timely updated LDGV emission factors, which are dependent on real-world activity levels. Here we constructed a big dataset of explicit emission profiles (e.g., emission factors and accumulated mileages) for 159,051 LDGVs based on an official I\/M database by matching real-time traffic dynamics via real-world traffic monitoring (e.g., traffic volumes and speeds). Consequently, we provide robust evidence that the emission factors of these LDGVs follow a clear heavy-tailed distribution. The top 10 % emitters contributed >60 % to the total fleet emissions, while the bottom 50 % contributed <10 %. Such emission factors were effectively reduced by 75.7\u201386.2 % as official emission standards upgraded gradually (i.e., from China 2 to China 5) within 13 years from 2004 to 2017.

The literature indicates that big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence has the ability to enhance supply chain performance, but there is limited research concerning the reasons for which firms engaging in manufacturing activities adopt big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence. To address this gap, our study employs institutional theory and resource-based view theory to elucidate the way in which automotive firms configure tangible resources and workforce skills to drive technological enablement and improve sustainable manufacturing practices and furthermore develop circular economy capabilities. We tested the research hypothesis using primary data collected from 219 automotive and allied manufacturing companies operating in South Africa. The contribution of this work lies in the statistical validation of the theoretical framework, which provides insight regarding the role of institutional pressures on resources and their effects on the adoption of big data analytics-powered artificial intelligence, and how this affects sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities under the moderating effects of organizational flexibility and industry dynamism.","Surajit Bag and Jan Ham Christiaan Pretorius and Shivam Gupta and Yogesh K.

Big Data appears in this context as a set of technologies that manage data to obtain information that supports decision-making. These systems were not conceived to be secure, resulting in significant risks that must be controlled. Security risks in Big Data must be analyzed and managed in an appropriate manner to protect the system and secure the information and the data being handled. This paper proposes a risk analysis approach for Big Data environments, which is based on a security analysis methodology called MARISMA (Methodology for the Analysis of Risks on Information System), supported by a technological environment in the cloud (eMARISMA tool) already used by numerous clients. Both MARISMA and eMARISMA are specifically designed to be easily adapted to particular contexts, such as Big Data.

Different issues have ascended in the area of Big data security such as infrastructure security, data privacy, data management and data integrity. Currently, Big data processing, analytics and storage is secured using cryptography algorithms, which are not appropriate for Big data protection over Cloud. In this paper, we present a solution for addressing the main issues in Big data security over Cloud. We propose a novel system architecture called the Secure Authentication and Data Sharing in Cloud (SADS-Cloud). There are three processes involved in this paper including (i). Big Data Outsourcing, (ii). Big Data Sharing and (iii). Big Data Management. In Big data outsourcing, the data owners are registered to a Trust Center using SHA-3 hashing algorithm. The MapReduce model is used to split the input file into fixed-size of blocks of data and SALSA20 encryption algorithm is applied over each block. In Big data sharing, data users participate in a secure file retrieval. For this purpose, user's credentials (ID, password, secure ID, and current timestamp, email id) are hashed and compared with that stored in a database. In Big data management, there are three important processes implemented to organize data. They are as follows: Compression using Lemperl Ziv Markow Algorithm (LZMA), Clustering using Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Indexing using Fractal Index Tree. The proposed scheme for these processes are implemented using Java Programming and performance tested for the following metrics: Information Loss, Compression Ratio, Throughput, Encryption Time and Decryption Time.","Uma Narayanan and Varghese Paul and Shelbi Joseph","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jksuci.2020.05.005","2022","A novel system architecture for secure authentication and data sharing in cloud enabled Big Data Environment","article"],["Medical artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technical asset to support medical supply-side reforms and national development in the big data era.

Subjective conventional methods have been applied frequently in past decades. However, due to increasingly complex product and supply chain structures, diverse working conditions, and massive amounts of components, accuracy and efficiency of root cause analysis are progressively challenged in practice. Therefore, data-driven root cause analysis methods have attracted attention lately. In this paper, taking advantage of the availability of big operations data and the rapid development of data science, we design a big data-driven root cause analysis system utilizing Machine Learning techniques to improve the performance of root cause analysis. More specifically, we first propose a conceptual framework of the big data-driven root cause analysis system including three modules of Problem Identification, Root Cause Identification, and Permanent Corrective Action. Furthermore, in the Problem Identification Module, we construct a unified feature-based approach to describe multiple and different types of quality problems by applying a data mining method. In the Root Cause Identification Module, we use supervised Machine Learning (classification) methods to automatically predict the root causes of multiple quality problems. Finally, we illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system and algorithms based on actual quality data from a case company.

In Industry 4.0, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Wireless Sensors (WSs) in the manufacturing processes, such as equipment, machining, assembly, material handling, inspection, etc., generates a huge volume of data known as Industrial Big Data (IBD). However, the reliable and efficient gathering and transmission of this big data from the source sensors to the floor inspection system for the real-time monitoring of unexpected changes in the production and quality control processes is the biggest challenge for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs). This is because of the harsh nature of the indoor industrial environment that causes high noise, signal fading, multipath effects, heat and electromagnetic interference, which reduces the transmission quality and trigger errors in the IWSNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel cross-layer data gathering approach called CBI4.0 for active monitoring and control of manufacturing processes in the Industry 4.0. The key aim of the proposed CBI4.0 scheme is to exploit the multi-channel and multi-radio architecture of the sensor network to guarantee quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as higher data rates, throughput, and low packet loss, corrupted packets, and latency by dynamically switching between different frequency bands in the Multichannel Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs). By performing several simulation experiments through EstiNet 9.0 simulator, the performance of the proposed CBI4.0 scheme is compared against existing studies in the automobile Industry 4.0. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes and is suitable for effective control and monitoring of various events in the automobile Industry 4.0.","Muhammad Faheem and Rizwan Aslam Butt and Rashid Ali and Basit Raza and Md.

This scenario is deeply changing the security landscape, introducing new risks and threats that affect security and privacy of systems, on one side, and safety of users, on the other side. Many domains that can benefit from novel solutions based on data analytics have stringent security requirements to fulfill. The Energy domain\u2019s Smart Grid is a major example of systems at the crossroads of security and data-driven intelligence. The Smart Grid plays a crucial role in modern energy infrastructure. However, it must face two major challenges related to security: managing front-end intelligent devices such as power assets and smart meters securely, and protecting the huge amount of data received from these devices. Starting from these considerations, setting up proper analytics is a complex problem because security controls could have the undesired side effect of decreasing the accuracy of the analytics themselves. This is even more critical when the configuration of security controls is let to the security expert, who often has only basic skills in data science. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the concept of Model-Based Big Data Analytics-as-a-Service (MBDAaaS) that bridges the gap between security experts and data scientists.

Big data processing has been combined with service and cloud computing, leading to a new class of services called \u201cBig Services\u201d. In this new model, services can be seen as an abstract layer that hides the complexity of the processed big data. To meet users' complex and heterogeneous needs in the era of big data, service reuse is a natural and efficient means that helps orchestrating available services' operations, to provide customer on-demand big services. However different from traditional Web service composition, composing big services refers to the reuse of, not only existing high-quality services, but also high-quality data sources, while taking into account their security constraints (e.g., data provenance, threat level and data leakage). Moreover, composing heterogeneous and large-scale data-centric services faces several challenges, apart from security risks, such as the big services' high execution time and the incompatibility between providers' policies across multiple domains and clouds. Aiming to solve the above issues, we propose a scalable approach for big service composition, which considers not only the quality of reused services (QoS), but also the quality of their consumed data sources (QoD). Since the correct representation of big services requirements is the first step towards an effective composition, we first propose a quality model for big services and we quantify the data breaches using L-Severity metrics. Then to facilitate processing and mining big services' related information during composition, we exploit the strong mathematical foundation of fuzzy Relational Concept Analysis (fuzzy RCA) to build the big services' repository as a lattice family. We also used fuzzy RCA to cluster services and data sources based on various criteria, including their quality levels, their domains, and the relationships between them. Finally, we define algorithms that parse the lattice family to select and compose high-quality and secure big services in a parallel fashion. The proposed method, which is implemented on top of Spark big data framework, is compared with two existing approaches, and experimental studies proved the effectiveness of our big service composition approach in terms of QoD-aware composition, scalability, and security breaches.","Mokhtar Sellami and Haithem Mezni and Mohand Said Hacid","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jnca.2020.102732","2020","On the use of big data frameworks for big service composition","article"],["Under rapid urbanization, cities are facing many societal challenges that impede sustainability.

The proposed methods are evaluated on two case studies, and autocorrelation-based noise analysis provides insight into the relative performance across machine health and operating conditions. Results indicate that physically-informed DCAE compression outperforms prevalent data compression approaches, such as compressed sensing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and DCAE with a standard loss function. FDAM can further improve the data reconstruction quality for certain machine conditions.","Matthew Russell and Peng Wang","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ymssp.2021.108709","2022","Physics-informed deep learning for signal compression and reconstruction of big data in industrial condition monitoring","article"],["Zusammenfassung\nHintergrund\nIn Deutschland leben etwa 4 Millionen Menschen mit einer seltenen Erkrankung.

Studies have shown that big data applications can improve diagnosis of and research on rare diseases more effectively. However, no concrete comprehensive concept for the use of big data in the care of people with rare diseases has so far been established in Germany. As part of the project \u201cBIDA-SE\u201d, which is funded by the German Ministry of Health, a first scenario has been designed to show how big data applications can be usefully incorporated into the care of people with rare diseases.\nMethods\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate this scenario with regard to acceptance, (clinical) benefits, economic aspects, and limitations and barriers to its implementation. To evaluate the scenario, an online survey was conducted in Germany in October\/November 2019 amongst a total of N\u00a0=\u00a09 physicians, N\u00a0=\u00a069 patients with rare diseases\/patient representatives, N\u00a0=\u00a014 IT experts and N\u00a0=\u00a021 health care researchers. The online questionnaire consisted of both standardized, validated questions taken from already tested survey instruments and additional questions which were constructed on the basis of a preceding literature analysis. The evaluation of the survey was primarily descriptive, with a calculation of frequencies, mean values and standard deviations.\nResults\nThe results of the evaluation show that the scenario has been accepted by a majority of all groups surveyed (physicians, patients\/patient representatives, IT experts and health care researchers). From the point of view of physicians, patients\/patient representatives and health care researchers, the scenario has the potential to accelerate the diagnosis and initiation of therapy and to improve cross-sectoral treatment. From the physician\u2019s and health care researcher\u2019s perspective, investments in the application presented in the scenario would be profitable. Financing the scenario would, however, require adjusting the reimbursement situation. The limitations and barriers identified by all groups for a medium-term implementation of the scenario can be grouped into seven thematic areas where action is needed: (1) financing and investment, (2) data protection and data security, (3) standards\/data sources\/data quality, (4) acceptance of technology, (5) integration into the daily work routine, (6) knowledge about availability as well as (7) habits and preferences\/physician's role.\nDiscussion\nWith the present study, a first interdisciplinary, practical scenario using big data applications was evaluated with regard to acceptance, benefits and limitations\/barriers. The scenario is widely accepted among the majority of all surveyed target groups and is considered (clinically) useful, although legal, organisational and technical barriers still need to be overcome for its medium-term implementation. The evaluation results contribute to the derivation of recommendations for action to ensure the medium-term implementation of the scenario and to channel access to the Centres for Rare Diseases in the future.\nConclusion\nMany activities have been initiated at a national level to improve the health care situation of people with rare diseases. The scenario developed in the \u201cBIDA-SE\u201d project complements these research activities and illustrates how big data applications can be usefully implemented into practice to improve the diagnosis and therapy of people with rare diseases in a sustainable way.","Brita Sedlmayr and Andreas Knapp and Mich\u00e9le K\u00fcmmel and Franziska Bathelt and Martin Sedlmayr","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.zefq.2020.11.002","2020","Evaluation eines Zukunftsszenarios zur Nutzung von Big-Data-Anwendungen f\u00fcr die Verbesserung der Versorgung von Menschen mit seltenen Erkrankungen","article"],["This is the first systematic literature review concerning the interconnections between big data (BD) and co-innovation.

Simply assuming that all buildings with the same structural type follow an identical life span can cause serious estimation errors. In this study, we collected 1,812,700 records describing buildings built and demolished in South Korea, analysed the actual life span of each building, and developed a building life-span prediction model using deep-learning and traditional machine learning.

Many natural cities beyond central cities contribute to polycentric development at the metropolitan level.

This paper reports on the open-source Pikalert\u00ae system that brings together weather information and real-time data from connected vehicles to provide crucial information to enhance the safety and efficiency of surface transportation systems. This robust framework can be applied to a diverse array of user community specifications and is designed to rapidly ingest more, unique data sets as they become available. Ultimately, the developmental framework of this system will provide critical environmental information necessary to promote the development, growth, refinement, and expanded adoption of automated and connected multi-modal vehicular systems globally.","Amanda R.

This paper developed a perception approach of surrounding rock class based on TBM operational big data and combined unsupervised-supervised learning. In data preprocessing, four data mining techniques (i.e., Z-score, K-NN, Kalman filtering, and wavelet packet decomposition) were used to detect outliers, substitute outliers, suppress noise, and extract features, respectively. Then, GMM was used to revise the original surrounding rock class through clustering TBM load parameters and performance parameters in view of the shortcomings of the HC method in the TBM-excavated tunnel. After that, five various ensemble learning classification models were constructed to identify the surrounding rock class, in which model hyper-parameters were automatically tuned by Bayes optimization. In order to evaluate model performance, balanced accuracy, Kappa, F1-score, and training time were taken into account, and a novel multi-metric comprehensive ranking system was designed. Engineering application results indicated that LightGBM achieved the most superior performance with the highest comprehensive score of 6.9066, followed by GBDT (5.9228), XGBoost (5.4964), RF (3.7581), and AdaBoost (0.9946).

Due to a large number of data sources, data source selection plays a crucial role in information integration, since it is costly and even impossible to access all data sources. Data Source selection should consider both efficiency and effectiveness issues. For efficiency, the approach should scale to large data source amount. From effectiveness aspect, data quality and overlapping of sources are to be considered. In this paper, we study source selection problem in Big Data and propose methods which can scale to datasets with up to millions of data sources and guarantee the quality of results. Motivated by this, we propose a new metric taking the expected number of true values a source can provide as a criteria to evaluate the contribution of a data source. Based on our proposed index, we present a scalable algorithm and two pruning strategies to improve the efficiency without sacrificing precision. Experimental results on both real world and synthetic data sets show that our methods can select sources providing a large proportion of true values efficiently and can scale to massive data sources.","Yiming Lin and Hongzhi Wang and Jianzhong Li and Hong Gao","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.ins.2018.11.029","2019","Data source selection for information integration in big data era","article"],["With the growing scale and complexity of city infrastructures, the need for data analysis and machine learning is becoming more and more prominent in the field of civil infrastructure sensing.

We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain.

Consequently, to conduct meaningful and useful data quality evaluations, business rules must be first completely identified and captured at the beginning of the evaluation to perform sound measurements. We propose that the evaluation leads to better and more interpretable and useful results when the potential contribution of these business rules to the measurement of the data quality characteristics is first evaluated, avoiding the inclusion in the evaluation of those not having potential contribution and the resulting waste of resources. Considering this, we feel that for a better management of business rules for data quality evaluation, it makes sense to group all business rules having an important contribution to the evaluation of data quality characteristics, something that other business rules management methodologies have not covered yet. Through our experiences in conducting industrial projects of data quality evaluations we identified six problems when collecting and grouping the business rules. These problems make data quality evaluation processes less efficient and more costly. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology to systematically collect, group and validate the business rules to avoid or to alleviate these problems. For the sake of generalization, comparability, and reusability, we propose to do the grouping for data quality characteristics and properties defined in ISO\/IEC 25012 and ISO\/IEC 25024, respectively.

Spatial patterns of urban vibrancy indicated by multisource urban sensing data (points-of-interest, social media check-ins, and mobile phone records) were investigated. A comprehensive urban vibrancy metric was formed by adaptively weighting these metrics. The association between urban vibrancy and demographic, economic, and built environmental factors was revealed with global regression models and local regression models.

The results demonstrate that four urban vibrancy metrics are all higher in the special economic zone (SEZ) and lower in non-SEZs but with different degrees of spatial aggregation. The influences of employment and road density on all vibrancy metrics are significant and positive. However, the effects of metro stations, land use mix, building footprints, and distance to district center depend on the vibrancy indicator and location. These findings unravel the commonalities and differences in urban vibrancy metrics derived from multisource urban big data and the hidden spatial dynamics of the influences of associated factors.

Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions.

In this study, we developed a 2017-based high-resolution (3\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0km) model-ready emission inventory for Guangdong Province (GD) by updating estimation methods, emission factors, activity data, and allocation profiles. In particular, a full-localized speciation profile dataset mapped to five chemical mechanisms was developed to promote the determination of VOC speciation, and two dynamic approaches based on big data were used to improve the estimation of ship emissions and open fire biomass burning (OFBB). Compared with previous emissions, more VOC emissions were classified as oxygenated volatile organic compound (OVOC) species, and their contributions to the total ozone formation potential (OFP) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region increased by 17%. Formaldehyde became the largest OFP species in GD, accounting for 11.6% of the total OFP, indicating that the model-ready emission inventory developed in this study is more reactive. The high spatial-temporal variability of ship sources and OFBB, which were previously underestimated, was also captured by using big data. Ship emissions during typhoon days and holidays decreased by 23\u201355%. 95% of OFBB emissions were concentrated in 9% of the GD area and 31% of the days in 2017, demonstrating their strong spatial-temporal variability. In addition, this study revealed that GD emissions have changed rapidly in recent years due to the leap-forward control measures implemented, and thus, they needed to be updated regularly. All of these updates led to a 5\u201317% decrease in the emission uncertainty for most pollutants.

Individual farmers are collecting increasing amounts of data (\u2018big data\u2019), which can help monitor the process of sustainable intensification at local level. In this study, we build upon such data to quantify the magnitude and identify the biophysical and management determinants of on-farm yield gaps and water productivity for the main arable crops cultivated in the Netherlands. The analysis focused on ware, seed and starch potatoes, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley and covered the period 2015\u20132017. A crop modelling approach based on crop coefficients (kc) and daily weather data was used to estimate the potential yield (Yp), radiation intercepted and potential evapotranspiration (ETP) for each crop. Yield gaps were estimated to be ca. 10% of Yp for sugar beet, 25\u201330% of Yp for ware, seed and starch potato and spring barley, and 35\u201340% of Yp for spring onion and winter wheat. Variation in actual yields was associated with water availability in key periods of the growing season as well as with sowing and harvest dates. However, the R2 of the fitted regressions was rather low (20\u201349%). Current levels of crop water productivity ranged between 13\u202fkg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for spring barley, ca. 15 kg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for seed potato, spring onion and winter wheat, 23\u202fkg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for ware potato and ca. 25\u202fkg\u202fDM\u202fha\u22121\u202fmm\u22121 for starch potato and sugar beet. These values are about half of their potential, but increasing actual water productivity further is restricted by rainfall amount and distribution. However, doing so should not be prioritized over reducing environmental impacts of these intensive cropping systems in the short-term and may require large investments from farm to regional levels in the long-term.

However, the increase in classification speed comes at a cost, as approximations are lossy, mis-assigning classes relative to the original reference classification algorithm. To address this problem, we introduce a Lossless Pruned Naive Bayes (LPNB) classification algorithm tailored to real-world, big data applications with thousands of classes. LPNB achieves significant speed-ups by drawing on Information Retrieval (IR) techniques for efficient posting list traversal and pruning. We show empirically that LPNB can classify text up to eleven times faster than standard Naive Bayes on a real-world data set with 7205 classes, with larger gains extrapolated for larger taxonomies. In practice, the achieved acceleration is significant as it can greatly cut required computation time. In addition, it is lossless: the output is identical to standard Naive Bayes, in contrast to extant techniques such as hierarchical classification. The acceleration does not rely on the taxonomy structure, and it can be used for both hierarchical and flat taxonomies.","Nanfei Sun and Bingjun Sun and Jian (Denny) Lin and Michael Yu-Chi Wu","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.bdr.2018.05.007","2018","Lossless Pruned Naive Bayes for Big Data Classifications","article"],["A cloud framework refers to the aggregation of components like development tools, middleware and database services, needed for cloud computing, which aids in developing, deploying and managing cloud based applications strenuously, consequently making it an efficacious paradigm for massive scaling of dynamically allocated resources and their complex computing.

Among them, the molecular-level advanced planning and scheduling system (MAPS) can realize the cost performance measurement under different production schemes for potential types of processable crude oil, which is conducive to more accurate selection of crude oil and prediction of crude oil properties. In addition, the whole process simulation can be used to understand the product quality changes under different crude oil blending schemes and different unit operating conditions, which is conducive to timely adjusting the product blending schemes according to economic benefits or ex-factory demands. The operation conditions of secondary units and even the properties of mixed crude oil can be deduced according to different product quality requirements. In the process of optimization, the Continuous Catalytic Reforming (CCR) unit in the refinery process, for example, introduces the application of large data analysis, including correlation analysis, single index detection, multidimensional data anomaly detection, and the parameters of the single objective optimization, a multi-objective parameter optimization analysis, unstructured data analysis, and forecast analysis based on material properties. Good practices in CCR units have also been extended to other oil refining and chemical units, such as Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and ethylene cracking. In terms of equipment preventive maintenance, it introduced how to integrated application of Internet of things, deep machine learning, knowledge map and other technology to build real-time and on-line distributed equipment health monitoring and early warning system, for early detection of equipment hidden danger, early warning, early treatment of providing effective means, guarantee equipment run healthy and stable for a long period of time, to reduce unplanned downtime losses. In particular, the establishment of equipment prediction model based on time series and AI can realize effective monitoring and early warning of equipment faults such as shaft displacement, shaft fracture, shell cracking, power overload, and prediction of equipment remaining life.","Wu Qing","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/B978-0-12-820714-7.00009-1","2021","Chapter 9 - Global Practice of AI and Big Data in Oil and Gas Industry","incollection"],["This paper investigates big data analytics research and application in supply chain management between 2010 and 2016 and provides insights to industries.

This growing data has several applications: businesses can use it to give a more personalized touch to their services, governments can use it to better allocate their funds, and companies can utilize it to select the best candidates for a job. While these applications may seem extremely enticing, there are a couple of problems that must be solved first, namely, data collection and extraction of useful patterns from the data. The disciplines of data mining and big data deal with these problems, respectively. But, as we have already discussed, the amount of data is so vast that any manual approach is extremely time intensive and costly. Thus this limits the potential outcomes from this data. This problem has been solved by the application of deep learning. Deep learning has allowed us to automate processes that were not only time intensive but also mentally arduous. It has achieved better than human accuracy in several types of discriminative and recognition tasks making it a viable alternative to inefficient human labor. Deep learning plays a vital role in this analysis and has enabled several businesses to comprehend customer needs and accordingly improve their own services, thus giving them the opportunity to outdo their competitors. Similarly, deep learning has also been instrumental in analyzing the trends and associations of securities in the financial market. It has even helped to create fraud detection and loan underwriting applications, which have contributed to making financial institutions more transparent and efficient. Apart from directly improving the efficiency in these fields, deep learning has also been instrumental in improving the fields of data mining and big data. Machine learning algorithms can actually utilize the existing data to predict the unknowns, including future trends in data. Due to its potential applications the field of machine learning is deeply interconnected with data mining. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms are often heavily dependent on the availability of huge datasets to ensure useful accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have allowed the different components of data (i.e., multimedia data) in the data mining process itself to be identified. Similarly, semantic indexing and tagging algorithms have allowed the processes of big data to speed up.

In most industrialized countries, when a death occurs, it is a legal requirement that a medical certificate based on the international form recommended by World Health Organization's (WHO) is filled in by a physician. The physician reports the causes of death that directly led or contributed to the death on the death certificate. The death certificate is then forwarded to a coding office, where each cause is coded, and one underlying cause is defined, using the rules of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, now in its 10th Revision (ICD-10). Recently, a growing number of countries have adopted, or have decided to adopt, the coding software Iris, developed and maintained by an international consortium1. This whole standardized production process results in a high and constantly increasing international comparability of cause-specific mortality data. While these data could be used for international comparisons and benchmarking of global burden of diseases, quality of care and prevention policies, there are also many other ways and methods to explore their richness, especially when they are linked with other data sources. Some of these methods are potentially referring to the so-called \u201cbig data\u201d field. These methods could be applied both to the production of the data, to the statistical processing of the data, and even more to process these data linked to other databases.

On the contrary, the M2M platforms that handle Big Data might perform poorly or not according to the goals of their operator (in term of cost, database utilization, data quality, processing and computational efficiency, analysis and feature extraction applications). Therefore, to address the aforementioned needs, we propose a new effective, memory and processing efficient system architecture for Big Data in M2M, which, unlike other previous proposals, does not require whole set of data to be processed (including raw data sets), and to be kept in the main memory. Our designed system architecture exploits divide-and-conquer approach and data block-wise vertical representation of the database follows a particular petitionary strategy, which formalizes the problem of feature extraction applications. The architecture goes from physical objects to the processing servers, where Big Data set is first transformed into a several data blocks that can be quickly processed, then it classifies and reorganizes these data blocks from the same source. In addition, the data blocks are aggregated in a sequential manner based on a machine ID, and equally partitions the data using fusion algorithm. Finally, the results are stored in a server that helps the users in making decision. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system architecture are implemented on Hadoop single node setup on UBUNTU 14.04 LTS core\u2122i5 machine with 3.2GHz processor and 4GB memory.

Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale, heterogeneous CPSs that utilise technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), surveillance, social media, and others to make informed decisions and drive the innovations of automation in urban areas. Such systems incorporate multiple layers and complex structure of hardware, software, analytical algorithms, business knowledge and communication networks, and operate under noisy and dynamic conditions. Thus, large-scale CPSs are vulnerable to enormous technical and operational challenges that may compromise the quality of data of their applications and accordingly reduce the quality of their services. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate data quality challenges in smart-cities large-scale CPSs and to identify the most common techniques used to address these challenges. This systematic literature review showed that significant work had been conducted to address data quality management challenges in smart cities, large-scale CPS applications. However, still, more is required to provide a practical, comprehensive data quality management solution to detect errors in sensor nodes\u2019 measurements associated with the main data quality dimensions of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, and consistency.

One obstacle to translating NGS into routine health care has been a lack of clinical trials evaluating NGS technologies, which could be used to populate cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). A key question is whether big data can be used to partially support CEAs of NGS. This question has been brought into sharp focus with the creation of large national sequencing initiatives. In this article we summarize the main methodological and practical challenges of using big data as an input into CEAs of NGS. Our focus is on the challenges of using large observational datasets and cohort studies and linking these data to the genomic information obtained from NGS, as is being pursued in the conduct of large genomic sequencing initiatives. We propose potential solutions to these key challenges. We conclude that the use of genomic big data to support and inform CEAs of NGS technologies holds great promise.

This is particularly challenging for California, which has high variability in natural (e.g, wildfires, dust) and anthropogenic emissions, meteorology, topography (e.g. desert surfaces, mountains, snow cover) and land use.\nMethods\nUsing ensemble-based deep learning with big data fused from multiple sources we developed a PM2.5 prediction model with uncertainty estimates at a high spatial (1\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0km) and temporal (weekly) resolution for a 10-year time span (2008\u20132017). We leveraged autoencoder-based full residual deep networks to model complex nonlinear interrelationships among PM2.5 emission, transport and dispersion factors and other influential features. These included remote sensing data (MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD), normalized difference vegetation index, impervious surface), MERRA-2 GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) output, wildfire smoke plume dispersion, meteorology, land cover, traffic, elevation, and spatiotemporal trends (geo-coordinates, temporal basis functions, time index). As one of the primary predictors of interest with substantial missing data in California related to bright surfaces, cloud cover and other known interferences, missing MAIAC AOD observations were imputed and adjusted for relative humidity and vertical distribution. Wildfire smoke contribution to PM2.5 was also calculated through HYSPLIT dispersion modeling of smoke emissions derived from MODIS fire radiative power using the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 model.\nResults\nEnsemble deep learning to predict PM2.5 achieved an overall mean training RMSE of 1.54\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 (R2: 0.94) and test RMSE of 2.29\u00a0\u03bcg\/m3 (R2: 0.87). The top predictors included M2GMI carbon monoxide mixing ratio in the bottom layer, temporal basis functions, spatial location, air temperature, MAIAC AOD, and PM2.5 sea salt mass concentration. In an independent test using three long-term AQS sites and one short-term non-AQS site, our model achieved a high correlation (>0.8) and a low RMSE (<3 \u03bcg\/m3). Statewide predictions indicated that our model can capture the spatial distribution and temporal peaks in wildfire-related PM2.5. The coefficient of variation indicated highest uncertainty over deciduous and mixed forests and open water land covers.\nConclusion\nOur method can be generalized to other regions, including those having a mix of major urban areas, deserts, intensive smoke events, snow cover and complex terrains, where PM2.5 has previously been challenging to predict. Prediction uncertainty estimates can also inform further model development and measurement error evaluations in exposure and health studies.","Lianfa Li and Mariam Girguis and Frederick Lurmann and Nathan Pavlovic and Crystal McClure and Meredith Franklin and Jun Wu and Luke D.

With biomedical imaging research increasingly using large datasets, it becomes critical to find operator-free methods to quality control the data collected and the associated analysis. Attempts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform automated quality control (QC) for both single-site and multi-site datasets have been explored in some neuroimaging techniques (e.g. EEG or MRI), although these methods struggle to find replication in other domains. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of an automated QC pipeline for brain [18F]-FDOPA PET imaging as a biomarker for the dopamine system. Methods. Two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were used and combined to assess spatial misalignment to a standard template and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to 200 static [18F]-FDOPA PET images that had been manually quality controlled from three different PET\/CT scanners. The scans were combined with an additional 400 scans, in which misalignment (200 scans) and low SNR (200 scans) were simulated. A cross-validation was performed, where 80% of the data were used for training and 20% for validation. Two additional datasets of [18F]-FDOPA PET images (50 and 100 scans respectively with at least 80% of good quality images) were used for out-of-sample validation. Results. The CNN performance was excellent in the training dataset (accuracy for motion: 0.86 \u00b1 0.01, accuracy for SNR: 0.69 \u00b1 0.01), leading to 100% accurate QC classification when applied to the two out-of-sample datasets. Data dimensionality reduction affected the generalizability of the CNNs, especially when the classifiers were applied to the out-of-sample data from 3D to 1D datasets. Conclusions. This feasibility study shows that it is possible to perform automatic QC of [18F]-FDOPA PET imaging with CNNs. The approach has the potential to be extended to other PET tracers in both brain and non-brain applications, but it is dependent on the availability of large datasets necessary for the algorithm training.","Antonella D.

On top of this, specific querying frameworks to exploit the brute force in the cloud (e.g., MapReduce) have also been devised. The question arising next tries to clear out if this (rather naive) exploitation of the cloud is an alternative to tuning DBMSs or it still makes sense to consider other options when retrieving data from these settings. In this paper, we study the feasibility of solving OLAP queries with Hadoop (the Apache project implementing MapReduce) while benefiting from secondary indexes and partitioning in HBase.

The AP-HP Clinical Data Repository aggregates EHR data from 37 hospitals to enable large-scale research and secondary data analysis. This paper describes the DQ program currently in place at AP-HP and the lessons learned from two DQ campaigns initiated in 2017.\nMaterials and Methods\nAs part of the AP-HP DQ program, two domains - patient identification (PI) and healthcare services (HS) - were selected for conducting DQ campaigns consisting of 5 phases: defining the scope, measuring, analyzing, improving and controlling DQ. Semi-automated DQ profiling was conducted in two data sets \u2013 the PI data set containing 8.8\u202fM patients and the HS data set containing 13,099 consultation agendas and 2122 care units. Seventeen DQ measures were defined and DQ issues were classified using a unified DQ reporting framework. For each domain, actions plans were defined for improving and monitoring prioritized DQ issues.\nResults\nEleven identified DQ issues (8 for the PI data set and 3 for the HS data set) were categorized into completeness (n\u202f=\u202f6), conformance (n\u202f=\u202f3) and plausibility (n\u202f=\u202f2) DQ issues. DQ issues were caused by errors from data originators, ETL issues or limitations of the EHR data entry tool. The action plans included sixteen actions (9 for the PI domain and 7 for the HS domain). Though only partial implementation, the DQ campaigns already resulted in significant improvement of DQ measures.\nConclusion\nDQ assessments of hospital information systems are largely unpublished.

While these aspects should influence production planning and control, current approaches to data evaluation are too complex to use them on a-day-to-day basis. In this paper, we propose a methodology that simplifies the execution of DQ evaluations and improves the understandability of its results. One of its main concerns is to make DQ assessment usable to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The approach takes selected, context related structured or semi-structured data as input and uses a set of generic test criteria applicable to different tasks and domains. It combines data and domain driven aspects and can be partly executed automated and without context specific domain knowledge. The results of the assessment can be summarized into quality dimensions and used for benchmarking. The methodology is validated using data from the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and manufacturing execution system (MES) of a sheet metal manufacturer covering a year of time. The particular application aims at calculating logistic key performance indicators. Based on these conditions, data requirements are defined and the available data is evaluated considering domain specific characteristics.","Lisa C.

We use six molecular markers to infer the phylogeny of Blattodea and apply various tests to assess relationship support, locus quality, and the relationship between the two. We use internode-certainty calculations in conjunction with bootstrap scores, alignment permutations, and an approximately unbiased (AU) test to assess if the molecular data unambiguously support the phylogenetic relationships found.

With the emergence of smartphones and navigation apps, location-based and crowdsourced Big Data are receiving increased attention. In this regard, location-based big data (LocBigData) collected from probe vehicles and road users can be used to provide speed and travel time information in different locations. Examining the quality of crowdsourced data is essential for researchers and agencies before using them. This study assessed the quality of Waze speed data from surface streets and conducted a case study in Sevierville, Tennessee. Typically, examining the quality of these data in surface streets and arterials is more challenging than freeways data. This research used Bluetooth speed data as the ground truth, which is independent of Waze data. In this study, three steps of methodology were used. In the first step, Waze speed data was compared to Bluetooth data in terms of accuracy, mean difference, and distribution similarity. In the second step, a k-means algorithm was used to categorize Waze data quality, and a multinomial logistics regression model was performed to explore the significant factors that impact data quality. Finally, in the third step, machine learning techniques were conducted to predict the data quality in different conditions. The result of the comparison showed a similar pattern and a slight difference between datasets, which verified the quality of Waze speed data. The statistical model indicates that that Waze speed data are more accurate in peak hours than in night hours. Also, the traffic speed, traffic volume, and segment length have a significant association on the accuracy of Waze data on surface streets.

Besides the pure ordinal information about the level of quality, numerical information is induced when considering uncertainty involved during measurement. In the case where uncertainty is modelled as probability, this numerical information is ratio-scaled. An essential property of the mentioned approach is that the application of a measure on a large collection of data can be represented efficiently in the sense that (i) the representation has a low storage complexity and (ii) it can be updated incrementally when new data are observed. However, this property only holds when the evaluation of predicates is clear and does not deal with uncertainty. For some dimensions of quality, this assumption is far too strong and uncertainty comes into play almost naturally. In this paper, we investigate how the presence of uncertainty influences the efficiency of a measurement procedure. Hereby, we focus specifically on the case where uncertainty is caused by insufficient information and is thus modelled by means of possibility theory. It is shown that the amount of data that reaches a certain level of quality, can be summarized as a possibility distribution over the set of natural numbers. We investigate an approximation of this distribution that has a controllable loss of information, allows for incremental updates and exhibits a low space complexity.","A. Bronselaer and J.

In particular, we develop a crawling tool to harvest the daily travel time from each community (8117) to each healthy food store (102) from the Baidu Map under four transport modes (walking, public transit, private car, and bicycle) during 17:30\u201320:30 in June 2016. Based on the travel time calculations, we develop four travel time indicators to measure the healthy food accessibility: the minimum, the maximum, the weighted average, and the standard deviation. Results show that the four accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the nearest service (minimum time) alone fails to reflect the multidimensional nature of healthy food accessibility. The communities within Shenzhen present quite different typology with respect to healthy food accessibility under different transport modes. Multilevel additive regression is further applied to examine the associations between healthy food accessibility and nested socioeconomic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). We discover that the associations are divergent with transport modes and with geographic levels. More specifically, significant social equalities in healthy food accessibility are identified via walking, public transit, and bicycle in Shenzhen. Based on the associations, we finally map the food deserts and propose corresponding planning strategies.

Historic data is increasingly being replaced by modernized data, such as big data, which is regarded as data that exhibits the 5Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and value. The capacity to optimally use and comprehend value from big data has become an indispensable aptitude for modern companies. In contrast to commercial and technology firms, usage, management and governance of data, including big data is a novel and evolving trend for mining and mineral industries. Although the mining industry can be unenthusiastic to change, embracing modernized data and big data is evolutionarily unavoidable, given many industry-wide challenges (i.e., fluctuation in commodity prices, geotechnical and harsh ground conditions, and ore grade), which corrode revenues and increase business risks, including the possibility of regulatory non-compliance. The minerals industry holds a genuine gold mine of data that were collected for scientific, engineering, operational and other purposes. Data and data-centric workspaces that are targeted towards innovation and experimentation, which if combined with in-discipline expertise are two harmonious ingredients that can provide many practical solutions for the mining and mineral industries. In this paper, the concept, the opportunity and the necessity for a move towards a technology- and innovation-based, data-centric \u2018dry laboratories\u2019 (common workspaces that facilitates data-centric experimentation and innovation) in the minerals industry are assessed.

Discrepancies with the gold standard were classified into plausibility, conformance, and completeness errors.\nResults\nData from 149 patients were included. Although there were no significant differences between the automatic method and the manual method, we detected differences in values for five variables, including one plausibility error and two conformance and completeness errors. Plausibility: 1) Sex, ICU-DaMa incorrectly classified one male patient as female (error generated by the Hospital\u2019s Admissions Department). Conformance: 2) Reason for isolation, ICU-DaMa failed to detect a human error in which a professional misclassified a patient\u2019s isolation. 3) Brain death, ICU-DaMa failed to detect another human error in which a professional likely entered two mutually exclusive values related to the death of the patient (brain death and controlled donation after circulatory death).

The goal of this network, members of which met for the first time in October 2014, is to establish a forum to collaborate in precompetitive space, to exchange and develop best practices, and to bring together the members from academia, pharmaceutical industry, publishers, journal editors, funding organizations, public\/private partnerships and non-profit advocacy organizations. To address the most pertinent issues identified by the Network, it was decided to establish a data sharing platform that allows open exchange of information in the area of preclinical neuroscience and to develop an educational scientific program. It is also planned to reach out to other organizations to align initiatives to enhance efficiency, and to initiate activities to improve the clinical relevance of preclinical data. Those Network activities should contribute to scientific rigor and lead to robust and relevant translational data.

It is also closely related to the safety and reliability of the power system operation and management based on data-driven decision support. In this paper, we study the data quality of electricity consumption data in a smart grid environment. First, we analyze the significance of data quality. Also, the definition and classification of data quality issues are explained. Then we analyze the data quality of electricity consumption data and introduce the characteristics of electricity consumption data in a smart grid environment. The data quality issues of electricity consumption data are divided into three types, namely noise data, incomplete data and outlier data. We make a detailed discussion on these three types of data quality issues. In view of that outlier data is one of the most prominent issues in electricity consumption data, so we mainly focus on the outlier detection of electricity consumption data. This paper introduces the causes of electricity consumption outlier data and illustrates the significance of the electricity consumption outlier data from the negative and positive aspects respectively.

As China is probably the largest personal data pool and vastest application market of big data, the situation of Chinese privacy trust plays a significant role. Based on the 17 most common data collection scenarios, the following aspects have been observed through 508 questionnaires and interviews of 20 samples. To start with, there is a severe privacy trust crisis in China, both in the field of enterprise services such as online shopping and social networks, etc. and in some public services like medical care and education, etc. Besides, there are also doubts about data collected by the government since individuals refuse to offer personal information or give false information as much as possible. Some people even buy two phone numbers, one is in use, while the other is not carried around or used by them, which is only bought to be offered to data collectors. Secondly, in terms of gender, females have lower trust in enterprises and social associations than males, especially in the fields of social networks and personal consumption. However, there is no obvious difference in fields of government and public services. Females possess stronger awareness but less skilled in precautions than males. Thirdly, people between the ages of 18 and 50 are more suspicious of data collected by enterprises, while age exerts little obvious influence on the credibility of data collected by the government, social associations and public services. Older people are less aware of precautions than people at other ages. In addition, from the perspective of education background, people with higher degrees possess stronger awareness of precautions and thus lower degree of trust. Therefore, it is suggested that more education on privacy consciousness should be given, and relative laws as well as regulations need improving. Besides, innovation in privacy protection technologies should be encouraged.

To deal with this problem, we propose a novel on-demand coverage based self-deployment algorithm for big data perception based on mobile sensing networks in this paper. Firstly, by considering characteristics of mobile sensing nodes, we extend the cellular automata model and propose a new mobile cellular automata model for effectively characterizing the spatial\u2013temporal evolutionary process of nodes. Secondly, based on the learning automata theory and the historical information of node movement, we further explore a new mobile cellular learning automata model, in which nodes can self-adaptively and intelligently decide the best direction of movement with low energy consumption. Finally, we propose a new optimization algorithm which can quickly solve the node self-adaptive deployment problem, thus, we derive the best deployment scheme of nodes in a short time. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm in this paper outperforms the existing algorithms by as much as 40% in terms of the degree of satisfaction of network coverage, the iterations of the algorithm, the average moving steps of nodes and the energy consumption of nodes. Hence, we believe that our work will make contributions to large-scale adaptive deployment and high performance sensing scenarios of the mobile sensing networks.","Yaguang Lin and Xiaoming Wang and Fei Hao and Liang Wang and Lichen Zhang and Ruonan Zhao","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2018.01.007","2018","An on-demand coverage based self-deployment algorithm for big data perception in mobile sensing networks","article"],["Any given health system needs to increase efficiency and effectiveness up to the point of requiring a transformation of their current model to ensure their sustainability and continuity.

The application of AIS data has developed from simply navigation-oriented research to now include trade flow estimation, emission accounting, and vessel performance monitoring. The AIS now provides high frequency, real-time positioning and sailing patterns for almost the whole world's commercial fleet, and therefore, in combination with supplementary databases and analyses, AIS data has arguably kickstarted the era of digitisation in the shipping industry. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature regarding AIS applications by dividing it into three development stages, namely, basic application, extended application, and advanced application. Each stage contains two to three application fields, and in total we identified seven application fields, including (1) AIS data mining, (2) navigation safety, (3) ship behaviour analysis, (4) environmental evaluation, (5) trade analysis, (6) ship and port performance, and (7) Arctic shipping. We found that the original application of AIS data to navigation safety has, with the improvement of data accessibility, evolved into diverse applications in various directions. Moreover, we summarised the major methodologies in the literature into four categories, these being (1) data processing and mining, (2) index measurement, (3) causality analysis, and (4) operational research. Undoubtedly, the applications of AIS data will be further expanded in the foreseeable future. This will not only provide a more comprehensive understanding of voyage performance and allow researchers to examine shipping market dynamics from the micro level, but also the abundance of AIS data may also open up the rather opaque aspect of how shipping companies release information to external authorities, including the International Maritime Organization, port states, scientists and researchers. It is expected that more multi-disciplinary AIS studies will emerge in the coming years.

For the HNSCC cohort we measured the resource requirements for Stature, and for the PCa cohort we demonstrated its impact on an example clinical analytics scenario.\nResults\nAll but 1 synonym group (\u201cHydrogel\u201d) was mapped to the corresponding TG-263 name, resulting in a TG-263 relabel rate of 99% (8837 of 8925 structures). For the PCa cohort, Stature matched a total of 5969 structures. Of these, 5682 structures were exact matches (ie, following local naming convention), 284 were matched via a synonym, and 3 required manual matching. This original radiation therapy structure names therefore had a naming inconsistency rate of 4.81%. For the HNSCC cohort, Stature mapped a total of 2956 structures (2638 exact, 304 synonym, 14 manual; 10.76% inconsistency rate) and required 7.5 clinician hours. The clinician hours required were one-fifth of those that would be required for manual relabeling. The accuracy of Stature was 99.97% (PCa) and 99.61% (HNSCC).\nConclusions\nThe Stature approach was highly accurate and had significant resource efficiencies compared with manual curation.","Thilo Schuler and John Kipritidis and Thomas Eade and George Hruby and Andrew Kneebone and Mario Perez and Kylie Grimberg and Kylie Richardson and Sally Evill and Brooke Evans and Blanca Gallego","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.adro.2018.09.013","2019","Big Data Readiness in Radiation Oncology: An Efficient Approach for Relabeling Radiation Therapy Structures With Their TG-263 Standard Name in Real-World Data Sets","article"],["In the digital age, the interaction between privacy, data protection and advanced technological developments such as big data analytics has become pertinent to Europol's effectiveness in providing accurate crime analyses.

Basic prediction, divorced from causal inference, is much easier with big data. Emergency care may benefit from this simpler application of big data. Historically, predictive analytics have played an important role in emergency care as simple heuristics for risk stratification. These tools generally follow a standard approach: parsimonious criteria, easy computability, and independent validation with distinct populations. Simplicity in a prediction tool is valuable, but technological advances make it no longer a necessity. Emergency care could benefit from clinical predictions built using data science tools with abundant potential input variables available in electronic medical records.

We propose an agenda for widening the application of predictive analytics in emergency care. Throughout, we express cautious optimism because there are myriad challenges related to database infrastructure, practitioner uptake, and patient acceptance.

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking\/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.","Dirk U.

In this paper we investigate the role of spatial context of human movements in inferring transport mode from mobile sensed data. For this we use data collected from more than 8000 participants over a period of four months, in combination with freely available geographical information. We develop a support vectors machines-based model to infer five transport modes and achieve success rate of 94%. The developed model is applicable across different mobile sensed data, as it is independent on the integration of additional sensors in the device itself.

Through effective utilization of condition monitoring and prediction information, CBM would enhance equipment reliability leading to reduction in maintenance cost. The proposed framework uses a CBM optimization method that utilizes a new linguistic interval-valued fuzzy reasoning method for predicting the information.

In particular, we propose a distance-based anomaly detection strategy which considers objects described by embedding features learned via a stacked auto-encoder. We then devise a repair strategy which repairs the data detected as anomalous exploiting non-anomalous data measured by sensors in nearby spatial locations. Subsequently, we adopt Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) to predict\/forecast values assumed by a target variable of interest for the repaired newly arriving (unlabeled) data, using the original feature representation or the embedding feature representation learned via the stacked auto-encoder.

A healthcare system is required to analyze a large amount of patient data, which helps to derive insights and predictions of disease. This system should be intelligent and able to predict the patient's health condition by analyzing the patient's lifestyle, physical health records, and social activities. The health recommendation system (HRS) is becoming an important platform for healthcare services. In this context, health intelligent systems have become indispensable tools in decision-making processes in the healthcare sector. The main objective is to ensure the availability of valuable information at the right time by ensuring information quality, trustworthiness, authentication, and privacy. As people use social networks to learn about their health condition, so the HRS is very important to derive outcomes such as recommending diagnosis, health insurance, clinical pathway-based treatment methods, and alternative medicines based on the patient's health profile. In this chapter, we discuss recent research that targeted utilization of large volumes of medical data while combining multimodal data from disparate sources, which reduces the workload and cost in healthcare. In the healthcare sector, big data analytics using a recommendation system has an important role in terms of decision-making processes regarding the patient's health. This chapter presents a proposed intelligent HRS that provides an insight into how to use big data analytics for implementing an effective health recommendation engine and shows how to transform the healthcare industry from the traditional scenario to more personalized paradigm in a tele-health environment.

The model takes expertise knowledge, online reviews, profile descriptions (e.g., hospital reputation, number of patients, city) and service quality (e.g., response speed, interaction frequency, cost) as signals that distinguish high-quality physicians. It uses machine learning approaches to derive similarity matches and sentiment analysis. It also measures the relative importance of the signals by multi-criterion analysis and derives the physician rankings through the aggregated scores. Our study revealed that the proposed approach performs better compared with the other two recommend techniques.

So far, most of the approaches for assuring data quality are typically data-centric, i.e., mainly focus on fixing data issues for specific values. However, organizations can also benefit from improving their capabilities of their DQM processes by developing organizational best DQM practices. In this regard, our investigation addresses how well organizations perform their DQM processes in the IoT domain. The main contribution of this study is to establish a framework for IoT DQM maturity. This framework is compliant with ISO 8000-61 (DQM: process reference model) and ISO 8000-62 (DQM: organizational process maturity assessment) and can be used to assess and improve the capabilities of the DQM processes for IoT data. The framework is composed of two elements. First, a process reference model (PRM) for IoT DQM is proposed by extending the PRM for DQM defined in ISO 8000-61, tailoring some existing processes and adding new ones. Second, a maturity model suitable for IoT data is proposed based on the PRM for IoT DQM. The maturity model, named IoT DQM3, is proposed by extending the maturity model defined in ISO 8000-62. However, in order to increase the usability of IoT DQM3, we consider adequate the proposition of a simplification of the IoT DQM3, by introducing a lightweight version to reduce assessment indicators and facilitate its industrial adoption. A simplified method to measure the capability of a process is also suggested considering the relationship of process attributes with the measurement stack defined in ISO 8000-63. The empirical validation of the maturity model is twofold. First, the appropriateness of the two models is surveyed with data quality experts who are currently working in various organizations around the world. Second, in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, the light-weight version is applied to a manufacturing company as a case study.","Sunho Kim and Ricardo P\u00e9rez-Castillo and Ismael Caballero and Downgwoo Lee","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jii.2021.100256","2022","Organizational process maturity model for IoT data quality management","article"],["The entity reconciliation (ER) problem aroused much interest as a research topic in today's Big Data era, full of big and open heterogeneous data sources.

Eleven digital libraries were analyzed following a systematic, semiautomatic and rigorous process that has resulted in 61 primary studies. They represent a great variety of intelligent proposals that aim to solve ER. The conclusion obtained is that most of the research is based on the operational phase as opposed to the design phase, and most studies have been tested on real-world data sources, where a lot of them are heterogeneous, but just a few apply to industry.

DQ2S encompasses a declarative query language and a data model that provides users with the capability to express constraints on the quality of query results as well as query quality-related information; a set of algebraic operators for manipulating data quality-related information, and optimization heuristics.

Effectively understanding the mechanism of their complex cooperative relationships is becoming an urgent and significant problem in information processing and management. Traditionally, these cooperation behavior are analyzed in a holistic and non-quantitative way, where the complicated relationships among various enterprises cannot be well represented. In this work, we propose to understand the low-carbon entrepreneurs\u2019 cooperation by leveraging a massive-scale dense subgraph mining technique, based on which an evolutionary graphical model is built to dynamically represent such complex relationships. More specifically, given million-scale low-carbon enterprises, we first extract multiple biologically-aware features (e.g., production value and carbon emission) to represent each of them. Based on this, a massive-scale affinity network is constructed to characterize the relationships among these enterprises. Based on this, an efficient subgraph mining algorithm (called graph shift) is deployed to discover the neighbors for each enterprise. Finally, based on the discovered neighbors of each enterprise, we can build a graphical model to represent the relationships among explicitly\/implicitly-connected enterprises. The flows of multiple attributes (benefit exchange and resources swap) can be modeled effectively. To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we manually label the attributes of 20,000 enterprises, based on which a classification model is trained by encoding the neighboring attributes of each enterprise. Comparative results have clearly demonstrated the competitiveness of our method. Moreover, visualization results can reveal the effectiveness of our method in uncovering the intrinsic distributions\/correlations of million-scale enterprises.","Yi Liu and Jie Xu and Weijie Yi","https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1016\/j.future.2021.01.002","2021","Massive-scale carbon pollution control and biological fusion under big data context","article"],["When the idea for this book was originally conceived, Big Data and Hadoop were not the most popular themes on the tech circuit, although cloud computing was somewhat more prominent.

To this end, an algorithm is used to determine the optimal year for component replacement based on three scenarios, a Reference scenario, an Imperfect information scenario, and an Investment in higher data quality scenario. Our results indicate that (i) the impact on the optimal year of replacement is the highest for middle-aged components; (ii) the profitability of investments in data quality improvement depends on various factors, including data quality, and the cost of investment in data quality improvement.

Firstly, a multimodal data fusion approach is proposed to build a QoE mapping between the uncontrollable user data with the controllable network-related system data. Secondly, an automatic QoE optimization model is built taking fused results, which is different from the traditional way. QoEDF is able to adjust network-related system data automatically so as to achieve optimized user satisfaction.

The concept aims at improving the results of decision making, enabling advanced data analyses, and increasing information handling efficiency. As insufficient information quality has immediate effects on the utility of the information and induces significant costs, managing the quality of the digital shadow data basis is crucial. However, there are currently no comprehensive methodologies for the assessment and improvement of the data quality of digital shadows. Therefore, this paper introduces a methodology that supports the derivation of data quality projects aimed at optimizing the digital shadow data basis. The proposed methodology comprises four steps: First, digital shadow use cases along the product lifecycle are described. Next, the use cases are prioritized with regard to the expected benefits of applying the digital shadow. Third, quality deficiencies in the digital shadow data basis are assessed with respect to use case specific requirements. Finally, the prioritized use cases in relation with the identified quality deficits allow deriving needs for action, which are addressed by data quality projects. Together, the data quality projects constitute a data quality program.

However, existing knowledge extraction systems retrieve data from limited types of Web sources. In addition, data fusion approaches consider very little of the noises produced by those knowledge extraction systems. Consequently, the constructed KBs are far from being comprehensive and accurate. In this paper, we present our initial design of a framework for extracting machine-readable data with high precision and recall from four types of data sources, namely Web texts, Document Object Model (DOM) trees, existing KBs, and query stream.

To this end, thresholds might need to be specified in order to limit the similarity degree in approximate comparisons or the occurrence of exceptions. Thanks to the availability of huge amount of data, including unstructured data available on the Web, nowadays it is possible to automatically discover rfds from data.

Hence, some recent work has focused on enabling in-memory databases to protect performance when the working data set almost fits in memory. Contrary to those prior efforts, we enable buffer pool designs to match in-memory performance while supporting the \\big data\\ workloads that continue to require secondary storage, thus providing the best of both worlds.

The difficulties come from the inherent ambiguity while independently parsing chunks of raw data without knowing the context of these chunks. Specifically, it can be difficult to find the beginnings and ends of fields and records in these chunks of raw data. To parallelize parsing, this paper proposes a speculation-based approach for the CSV format, arguably the most commonly used raw data format. Due to the syntactic and statistical properties of the format, speculative parsing rarely fails and therefore parsing is efficiently parallelized in a distributed setting. Our speculative approach is also robust, meaning that it can reliably detect syntax errors in CSV data.

We find that all DP architectures have less than 5% loss of prediction accuracy when the weak privacy guarantee is adopted (e.g., privacy budget parameter \u03b5 \u2265 3). However, when the strong privacy guarantee is assumed (e.g., privacy budget parameter \u03b5 \u2264 0:1), all DP architectures lead to 15% ~ 30% accuracy loss, which implies that real-word industrial data mining systems cannot work well under such a strong privacy guarantee recommended by previous research works. Among the three basic DP architectures, the Hybridized DM (Data Mining) and DB (Database) architecture performs the best because of its complicated privacy protection design for the specific data mining algorithm. Through extensive experiments on big data, we also observe that the accuracy loss increases by increasing the variety of features, but decreases by increasing the volume of training data. Therefore, to make DP practically usable in large-scale industrial systems, our observations suggest that we may explore three possible research directions in future: (1) Relaxing the privacy guarantee (e.g., increasing privacy budget \u03b5) and studying its effectiveness on specific industrial applications; (2) Designing specific privacy scheme for specific data mining algorithms; and (3) Using large volume of data but with low variety for training the classification models.","Hu Xueyang , Yuan Mingxuan , Yao Jianguo , Deng Yu , Chen Lei , Yang Qiang , Guan Haibing , Zeng Jia ","10.14778\/2824032.2824067","2015","Differential privacy in telco big data platform","inproceedings"],["In the background of today's big data era, the popularization of computer network and information technology helps us to understand and disseminate the hot information in the current society more quickly.

We present a thorough glyph design, which is founded in a comprehensive survey of related work and report the results of a controlled experiments, where participants solved data analysis tasks with both glyphs and a traditional textual display of data values.","Keck Mandy , Kammer Dietrich , Gr\u00fcnder Thomas , Thom Thomas , Kleinsteuber Martin , Maasch Alexander , Groh Rainer ","10.1145\/3105971.3105979","2017","Towards Glyph-based visualizations for big data clustering","inproceedings"],["The Big Data technology has paved a new way to provide inputs for the educational activities. The Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithmthat is widely used for Big Data application. CBR has the ability to give a solution based on previous experiences like a human in making a decision. Thus, this study has designed and developed an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that utilized the CBR to suggest the most suitable learning material to the students based on the real-time information of the students' profiles. The application has been tested in actual setting and the results show that the students that have been presented with personalized learning materials performed significantly better than the students that were presented with non-personalized lessons. The application also has the ability to calculate the similarity between cases accurately and presented the students with the most suitable learning materials.","Masood Mona , Mokmin Nur Azlina Mohamed ","10.1145\/3152723.3152735","2017","Case-based Reasoning Intelligent Tutoring System: An Application of Big Data and IoT","inproceedings"],["The popularization of systems, applications and devices to produce, view and share multimedia, saw the need to treat a large volume of data arise. In related areas (such as Multimedia Big Data, Data Science and Multimedia Information Retrieval) a key step is commonly referred as Multimedia Indexing or Multimedia Big Data Analysis, where the aim is to represent multimedia content into smaller, more manageable units, allowing the extraction of data features and information essential to the proper performance of the associated services. This mini-course discusses current tools and techniques for indexing, extracting and processing of multimodal multimedia content. The techniques are exemplified in Python OpenCV over different content (like images, audio, text and video), leading to the interest of services like Netflix, Google and YouTube on this subject, attracting the interest of researchers and developers.","Goularte Rudinei , Trojahn Tiago H. , Kishi Rodrigo M.

At Unravel, we build the next-generation APM platform for the big data stack, and we have worked with a representative sample of these enterprises that covers most industry verticals. This sample covers the spectrum of choices for deploying the big data stack across on-premises datacenters, private and public cloud deployments, and hybrid combinations of these. In this paper, we present a solution for assisting enterprises planning the migration of their big data stacks from on-premises deployments to the cloud. Our solution is goal driven and adapts to various migration scenarios. We present the system architecture we built and several cloud mapping options. We also describe a demonstration script that involves practical, real-world use-cases of the path to cloud adoption.","Giannakouris Victor , Fernandez Alejandro , Simitsis Alkis , Babu Shivnath ","10.1145\/3299869.3320240","2019","Cost-Effective, Workload-Adaptive Migration of Big Data Applications to the Cloud","inproceedings"],["The International Workshop on Semantic Big Data (SBD) is already in the fourth year in conjunction with the ACM SIGMOD Conference.
